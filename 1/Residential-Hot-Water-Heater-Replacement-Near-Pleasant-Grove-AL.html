Maintaining your equipment might seem unnecessary at times but will improve the life of your water heater as well as save you from having to replace it as often. Like most common appliances, this particular plumbing fixture runs on electricity to effectively heat up water.</p>

Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
