<h2>Water Heater Services Spring City Tennessee</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues. With a Rinnai® tankless water heater you'll enjoy the total confidence that comes with more than 30 years of innovation, support and integrity. A tankless water heater not only offer on-demand hot water, but this type of water heater comes in both electric and gas options.</p>
<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas. We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>

Cold water- Cold water could be the result of several different issues, such as a broken thermostat, a pilot light that may be out, a circuit breaker that may have tripped, or even a heating element that may be faulty.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters.

Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process).

<p>Every year flush the water in your water heater - this simple procedure clears the tank of sediment build-up, prolonging the service of both the tank and the heating element. They do this by running the water across a series of heating elements and then directly to your faucet. The T&P deposit pipe should not be connected to a drain; if the valve opens and the water goes down a drain, you might miss early warning signs of a problem in your water heater that could worsen if not addressed.</p>
