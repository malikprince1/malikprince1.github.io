<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>

<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater. When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem. If a professional plumber installed a closed system, it is unlikely that an expansion chamber or tank was not installed at the same time.

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Small apartments or limited use, such as in the case of having a single source for hot water access, may benefit from a single-point hot water tank. Tankless heaters last up to twenty-five years or more. Call (630) 577-9241 or (815) 609-1859 to discuss your water heater installation options.
