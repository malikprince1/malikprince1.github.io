<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>

The Rheem® Combination Boiler joins the benefits of a tankless water heater with those of a hydronic boiler—all in one one space-saving unit.
