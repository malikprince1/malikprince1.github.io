<h2>Water Heater Services Milltown New Jersey</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>

When you need to take a shower, wash your hands, or do a load of laundry using warm water, the tankless water heater will heat up water on demand.</p>
<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns. If installed properly, your tankless water heater should not require much maintenance and can run for twice as long as a conventional storage (tank) water heater.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Tankless water heaters require less energy, but they also are money to purchase and install. Clean where you're new tank will sit since you won't have access to this spot again for some time and once the new tank goes in, it could be hard to tell if you have new water messes or old water messes when you're testing the connections and such for your new tank. Contact a water damage company and your insurance agent to start the process right away because time is of the essence.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections. Reliable - With a properly sized unit, you'll always have a continuous supply of hot water at a preset temperature.
