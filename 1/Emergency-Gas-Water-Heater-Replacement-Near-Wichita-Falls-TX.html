<h2>Water Heater Services Wichita Falls Texas</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>
