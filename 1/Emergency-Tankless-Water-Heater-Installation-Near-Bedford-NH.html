I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000. Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future. Mallick Plumbing & Heating is the Service Contractor of Choice in Silver Spring, MD and throughout Montgomery County. Storage tank water heaters have lower initial cost by a significant margin.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity.

<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point.

Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Because a direct vent water heater has fewer moving parts in it with fewer things to go wrong, it will carry either a 6-, 9- or 12-year warranty, whereas a powered vent water heater will typically cap out at a 6-year warranty.

Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
