Smith lightweight and easy-to-install electric tankless water heaters can be mounted in small or tight spaces throughout your home. Worse yet… you arrive home after a nice evening out only to find your home or garage is flooded because from your water heater leaking. For the purpose of cost and efficiency, it's important to have an appropriately sized hot water storage tank. These units are a good choice for any household whose demand for hot water is not more than two points at a time.</p>

<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient.

Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>As a water heater ages, sediment will build up on the bottom of the tank.

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>

Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>On-demand water heaters don't require repairs as often as conventional water heaters, but they do need regular service. Tankless water heaters are sized according to its maximum temperature rise possible at a given flow rate. The two pipes coming out of the top of every water heater tank are the supply and delivery pipes ; one is the cold-water inlet pipe and the other is the hot-water outlet pipe The cold-water inlet pipe carries cold water from your home's water supply into the tank where it comes out of the dip tube , filling the tank with water to be heated.</p>
