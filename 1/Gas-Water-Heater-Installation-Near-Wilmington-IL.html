<h2>Water Heater Services Wilmington Illinois</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>While most homeowners are used to their tanked system, a tankless water heater offers improved performance while saving on energy costs.

Open a faucet to full "hot" to purge air from the water pipes and heater. We'll make sure the tankless heating units you select have the proper capacity and best feature set to support the hot water requirements of your specific industry.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Repair Wilmington</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>Tankless electric units have shorter life spans, on the order of 7 to 10 years. Your vent is undersized at 3”. This application requires a short water heater, a minimum of a 12” connector rise, 4” vent, and a new gas cock. Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters. For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>

<p>Once a new water heater of the proper size has been selected, it needs to be hooked up to the waterline. Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air. With a replacement, you can have a water heater that doesn't require frequent repairs, and you can have a more energy efficient water heater. Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>Either way, here are your primary water heating options. Note that the water heater should not share a circuit with another appliance—it draws too much power when heating. Tankless water heaters have been widely used in Europe and Japan for decades, and have become increasingly popular in North America as the Green Movement has gained traction. The direct vent tankless gas water heater is a bit different in that the combustion air comes directly from outside by way of a gas burner.</p>
<p>The drain valve is located at the bottom of the water heater. And there are no large electrical power demands needed as with the electric heater. Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced. With a tankless water heater you can eliminate this heat loss because the water is only heated when you need it. This can end up saving money on your monthly energy bill and conserve energy.</p>
