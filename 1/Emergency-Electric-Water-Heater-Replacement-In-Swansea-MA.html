<h2>Water Heater Services Swansea Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Repair Swansea</h3>

Compare the cost of electricity consumed and the heating method.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>

If you are ready to enjoy the benefits of a tankless unit, call us at (847) 855-0075 for an immediate installation. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
<p>The good news is that by deciding to do it yourself, you will be saving anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 in installation costs. Depending on the weather and other components, you have several selections for powering your new water heater. Gas heaters require a steady supply of oxygen and this is usually sucked from the area surrounding the heater. Most people don't think about plumbing too often, and that's how it should be.

<p>If it's your water heater, a repair isn't an option. Tankless water heater installation costs may be less than you think. The main disadvantage of tankless water heaters is their upfront cost (unit and installation) is significantly higher than tank-style heaters. We have seen our fair share of bad thermostats, heating elements, and check valves. You can change a thermocouple on most water heaters with only a small adjustable wrench.</p>
<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
