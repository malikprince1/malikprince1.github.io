<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>

After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials. Next if your heater came with a T&P valve unbox it and pipe dope those threads.</p>
<p>Of course, the TP valve or pipe could still be warm if the water heater stopped working within the last 3 or 4 hours because the water inside would still be holding some heat. Tankless heaters are much more expensive than ordinary water heating systems. Regardless of the type of water heater that is in your home, it is an inevitability that you will experience some kind of issues with it. Usually, this is in the form of no hot water coming out of your faucets or shower.</p>
