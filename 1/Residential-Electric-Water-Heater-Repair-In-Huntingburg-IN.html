<h2>Water Heater Services Huntingburg Indiana</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient. Simply put, changing the size of your water heater is usually not an option in an RV. Install a shutoff valve to the cold water inlet. If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>

Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>

However, if you don't have a large family, you may benefit from the cost savings of a tankless water heater.
