<h2>Water Heater Services Kingsland Texas</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well you maintain and care for your water heater, the average life span of most water heaters is from 8 to 12 years.

<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs.

We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>

Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem.
