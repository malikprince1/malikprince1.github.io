<h2>Water Heater Services Mullins South Carolina</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you live in a rented apartment or your own home, hot water heater technology plays a very important role in your everyday life. In the instance that there is not enough hot water and you have ensured that the tank is not leaking, you can flush the tank so that mineral deposits are not reducing its efficiency. If your water heater is exhibiting any of the above signs or if it has stopped working all together, it's time to call in your local professionals. Gas heaters are also historically less expensive than electric heaters to run. When repair costs begin to outweigh the benefit it's time to replace your tankless water heater.</p>

First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.
