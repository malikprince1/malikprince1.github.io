The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it. It's pretty clear that this will cause an increase in water being run down the drain, costing the home owner money, wasting one of our most precious resources.</p>
