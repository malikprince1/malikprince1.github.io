<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Lexington</h3>
<p>Should you choose to have your electric tankless water heater installed professionally, make sure you use a reputable company. The main drawback is that once the hot water is gone, you'll have to wait for the water inside of the tank to reheat. Replacement with a larger tank may help. 3. Cost-effectiveness: Since tankless water heaters only run as needed, lower utility bills means your tankless unit saves you money over time.</p>
<p>If your main water heater is broken, but one of the above conditions exist, the dishwasher will have hot water despite the broken main water heater. Here's how the pros make sure your heater delivers enough hot water. These elements are relatively easy to check and replace. First pipe dope the two shafts coming out the top of the heater. Offer professional tankless water heater installation, maintenance and service. These models have a tank like a conventional water heater, but they capture exhaust gases that would normally go out the flue, which wastes energy.</p>
<p>July 1, 2007 - WH conversion to FVIR design has been extended to all residential water heaters with inputs of 75 000 BTU's or less including Power Direct-Vent, Direct-Vent, Manufactured Housing and larger gallon capacity models not covered in the first two phases. Improper installation of a water heater could cause catastrophic damage or injury if the unit is not installed properly. Single-point electric tankless units start at around $115, or gas-powered, single-point tankless can be used to supplement for about $130.</p>
<p>Innovative technology provides an endless supply of hot water whenever and wherever it's needed. Let us help you decide on the best water heater for your home, lifestyle, and budget. We are also happy to install a tankless water heater or upgrade your current heater. Installing solar water heaters may seem expensive to you at first, but really the installation is very cost effective-as it pays for itself over a matter of a couple years.</p>
<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Lexington MA</h3>
<p>The size of the openings for combustion air — from indoors or outdoors — is based upon the tankless unit's Btu input. Tankless water heaters for RVs are becoming increasingly popular specifically for this. I was impressed the first time that I saw a tankless water heater. Even if you have an existing gas line, it may need to be upgraded to a bigger pipe in order to accommodate the power needed to fuel the tankless unit.</p>
<p>In addition to providing expert tankless water heater repairs, we also specialize in installations and replacements. Other materials, including heat pumps and pipes, are not included in standard installation costs. In locations where water has a high mineral content, otherwise known as hard water, add a water softener to reduce the unwanted effects that those mineral deposits can have on the water heater tank.</p>
<p>The type of tankless water heater chosen for any given application will depend on incoming water temperatures and building use patterns. And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs. With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>

Note: Our Customer Service Professionals are happy to help you determine this information over the phone if you are unable to find the specifications on your current water heater. Gas hot water problems or electric hot water heater problems can sometimes be easily fixed.

<p>8. A good indicator for both electric and gas heaters is the sacrificial anode rod. Your water heater is under constant stress to deliver enough hot water for your family. There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be. A water leak could be the cause as to why the hot water doesn't reach the showerhead and faucets. A cold climate can push tankless heaters right up to the limits of their capabilities.</p>
<p>If you know the different types of water heaters available in the market, it is easier to make the right decision when purchasing one. Although a tankless water heater can cost more to install, many still consider it a worthwhile investment because tankless systems can last up to 20 years. Replacing the anode rod at the first sign of a problem is critical to extending the life of your water heater. A tankless water heater is compact and highly efficient.</p>
<p>We'll make sure that it can provide plenty of hot water for you and your family and that it meets or exceeds your energy efficiency goals. Efficiency: If your water heater is of an older make and model, upgrading to a new, energy-efficient appliance will pay for itself over time.

Improper water heater installation can lead to a fire, flood or possibly death. Energy savings: Tankless water heaters are also called on demand” water heaters because they only heat water when there is demand for it; i.e., when a hot water tap comes on in the house demanding hot water.</p>
