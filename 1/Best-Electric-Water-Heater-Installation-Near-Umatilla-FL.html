So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated.

<p>Because water heaters are in constant contact with water, it's common for them to deteriorate over time. The overall cost of owning a water heater will depend on a number of factors such as the number of people using the heater, operating expenses, and remodeling done in the home. Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
