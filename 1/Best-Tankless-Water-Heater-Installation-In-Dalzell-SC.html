Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>

<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Dalzell</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>

Our plumbing experts will provide you with full service drain cleaning solutions.

Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install.

A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside.
