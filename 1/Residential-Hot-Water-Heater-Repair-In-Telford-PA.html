<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale.

Your water heater works silently around the clock to give you a constant supply of warm water. Look out for the energy factor (EF) too, as this indicates how well the unit can converts its fuel to heat. Water quality is an important consideration for all water equipment, and water heaters will often be impacted the most.</p>
