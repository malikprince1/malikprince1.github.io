<h2>Water Heater Services Sunbury Ohio</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute. Tankless water heaters operate by turning on as a hot water tap or appliance is activated, heating the water through a heat exchanger as it is moved to the faucet, dishwasher, washing machine, or shower head. Be sure to look into tankless water heaters because, with this type, you never run out of hot water.</p>

<p>Space-saving tankless water heaters only heat water when you demand it. This model of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water as it's needed. A leak in the tank- If there is a leak in the tank of the water heater, you need to replace your equipment. Step 6. Drain the water heater by connecting a water hose to the drain connection at the bottom of the water heater. Gas hot water heater installation cost is typically between $250 and $700 for hot water system replacing an old hot water installation with the same type hot water installation in the same spot.</p>
<p>If you have water on the floor or on top of the unit (this is different from water leaking from a supply line above the unit), you'll probably need a new water heater. This is because they don't deal with the stress of water stored in a tank and the continual need to use energy to keep the water heater. We will help you diagnose the problem and get your water heater started again.

Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Whether you choose gas or electric, there are many ways to get savings out of a tankless hot water heater.</p>
