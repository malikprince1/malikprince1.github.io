<p>Your water heater would routinely be splashed with water or other liquids. Note: Our Customer Service Professionals are happy to help you determine this information over the phone if you are unable to find the specifications on your current water heater. Gas hot water problems or electric hot water heater problems can sometimes be easily fixed. A small, air-source heat pump installed on top of the hot water storage tank pumps hot, pressurized refrigerant compound into a heat exchanger located in or around the hot water tank.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
<p>Besides the kind of water heater that's available, it's important for the homeowner to consider the cost. Typically, electric tankless water heaters cost more to operate than gas units.

<p>If the hot water system installation needs additional fittings or if the plumbing or electrical installation requires upgrading, the hot water system installation cost rises. Chances are the clue that tipped you off to your water heater problem was a lack of hot water. With an electric heater, you will need to flip the breaker switch to "off". Also a couple of easy do-it-yourself projects such as insulating hot water pipes and regulating your water heating temperature, can also contribute to saving both money and energy on your water heating.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
