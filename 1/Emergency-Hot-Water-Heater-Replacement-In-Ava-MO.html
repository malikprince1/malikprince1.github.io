<h2>Water Heater Services Ava Missouri</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>

You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>

<p>It may be difficult to figure out what's wrong with your hot water heater on your own, so instead, make an appointment with Timothy Off. We provide a range of system types, brands, and sizes, including tank, tankless, hybrid, heat pump, and solar water heaters. With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
