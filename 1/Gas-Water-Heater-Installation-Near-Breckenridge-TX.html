Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel. From our experience in both commercial water heater repair and those of private homes, we have identified various reasons leading to regular repairs and fixed them for our clients. By installing a unit that's similar to a standard tank water heater, you can experience hot water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Clean the pipes beforehand with steel wool if you want to reduce the amount of buildup in the water heater, but it is not required as there is only a little bit of deposit that could get into the heater from copper tubing. Water heaters must be properly maintained. We fix all makes and models—including both standard and tankless water heaters.
