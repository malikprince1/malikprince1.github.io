<h2>Water Heater Services Somerset Kentucky</h2>
<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready. Water heaters are fired by gas or electricity. Water leaks and gas leaks can be fixed by tightening the connections or soldering the pipes. Tankless water heaters also have limited output. Whether you're looking for a quick repair or a comprehensive installation, Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.</p>
<p>The tankless water heater must be able to deliver this maximum flow rate at the desired temperature rise. With the amount of money you'll save on energy costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and longer-lasting nature of these systems, you'll enjoy safer and more reliable warm water for longer, which keeps more money in your pocket where it belongs. For instance, less natural resources go into the manufacturing of these compact size heaters.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system. No matter your reason for choosing a tankless version, you can rest assured that our fully licensed contractors have the knowledge, skills, and resources to complete your tankless water heater installation quickly and efficiently.</p>

If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters can be repaired and have parts exchanged as well, so replacing the entire water heater every 6-8 years is a thing of the past. In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>
