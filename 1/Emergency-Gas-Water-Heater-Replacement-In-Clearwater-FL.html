The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Clearwater</h3>
<p>If the heating element burns out, there's no heat to apply to the water. Once this occurs, it is necessary for a replacement to occur and to contact your local plumbing contractor. When sized appropriately, a constant supply of hot water is delivered to your home with ease. But you'll need to deal with pipes, gas lines or electrical.

Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
