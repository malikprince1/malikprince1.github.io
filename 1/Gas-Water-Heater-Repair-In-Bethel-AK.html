While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason.

<p>As the water flows over the coils it is properly heated so you never have to wait for it to get to the right temperature when it reaches the outlet. If using a single point unit, you want the unit fairly close to where the hot water will be used in order to deliver the water in a timely way. Storage tank water heaters are commonly found in most homes. Connect the shutoff valve and the sediment trap to the water heater following the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>It can also involve the pressure relief valve, which is supposed to let water out only if the internal temperature and pressure get too high.
