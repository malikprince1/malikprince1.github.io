The two types of solar water heating systems are known as flat plate collectors and batch collectors.</p>
<p>The majority of people don't have their water heater stored in a conspicuous place so the color is of lesser importance and the appearance is not relevant either.

<p>Installation is easier and less expensive, and they're generally not as difficult to maintain as gas models.

However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat.
