If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas coming from its location, you have a potentially dangerous situation on your hands.

<p>Since there is no tank to fill and refill, tankless water heaters give you an endless supply of hot water, so it doesn't matter how many people are using it at any given time. On-Demand Tankless Hot Water Heaters have been gaining popularity as home and business owners have become more concerned with energy costs.

<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>

<p>But regular tankless water heater repair is needed to enjoy energy savings. Too much sediment: Hot water tanks see a ton of usage over the years, especially if you have a large family. We are able to provide repairs for gas , electric , as well as tankless and tank water heaters. If you use less than 41 gallons of hot water per day, a tankless heater is 24%-34% more efficient than a tank-style heater. If your water heater stops working as it should, knowing the basics can potentially save you time and money, and will better prepare you for repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>If you do opt for a whole house tankless heater then get yourself a hot water demand system. If your water heater has an EF of at least 0.82, you can qualify for federal tax credit. Incorrect installations can shave years off your water heater, can significantly reduce its performance, and can expose you to unsafe conditions. These small systems can be installed easily and provide you with pinpoint temperature accuracy for all your water heating needs.</p>
