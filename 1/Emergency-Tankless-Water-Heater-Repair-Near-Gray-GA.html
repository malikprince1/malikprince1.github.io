<h2>Water Heater Services Gray Georgia</h2>
<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater. If your water heater is older and you need frequent repairs to keep it running smoothly, a new unit is likely a good idea.</p>
<p>Usually, these tanks hold enough hot water to meet the needs of the entire house. When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>And obviously, tankless water heaters take up much less space than the hulking behemoth of an old fashioned storage water heater. Our water heater repair will fix problems with any make and type of burners and other heating parts. Request us today for a free estimate on installing a new unit. Environmentally Friendly: Improved efficiency also leads to a reduced carbon footprint, making a tankless water heater installation a great move to make your home greener.</p>
<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Repair Gray</h3>
<p>It is certainly true that tankless water heaters, technically speaking, really are more efficient than most tank type water heaters, even if the manufacturers' claims might be a little optimistic. After years of wear and tear, it may be time to schedule a water heater replacement. This requires energy (fuel) even when you don't need hot water. The two types of solar water heating systems are known as flat plate collectors and batch collectors.</p>

Trust Hunts for your hot water tank repairs and know that it will be fixed right the first time and backed by our warranty. If you have a gas heater and there is no hot water this can usually be attributed to the pilot light going out. Tankless water heaters continue to grow in popularity, and many homeowners may wonder whether upgrading is worth it. In general, these water heaters are a good idea for smaller to medium sized houses, as they are highly efficient.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing. When purchased from a Rinnai® authorized dealer and installed by a licensed installation professional, your Rinnai® tankless water heater comes with a generous warranty to give you even more peace of mind.</p>

Protect yourself against higher future replacement costs due to inflation and higher costs of living. Maintenance plays a big role in the lifespan of your water heater.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine. Because tankless heaters do not store water, they are less subject to corrosion than tank-type heaters. All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical has all your water heater services covered.</p>
<p>The rate of hot water produced by a tankless water heater is two to five gallons per minute, depending on the heating style used. The very same holds true for refurbished tankless water heaters. Installing a water heater costs $800 and $1,506, or an average of $1,125, including the unit and labor. On average, you can expect your tankless water heater unit to last a minimum of 20 years before it needs major repairs and replacement.</p>

Regular maintenance also extends the life of your water heater.</p>

With tankless heaters you have the benefit of an endless supply of hot water. A tankless water heater is less likely to corrode than a storage tank system, but if the pipes start to leak, corrosion can start up. If the corrosion develops too far, the whole system may need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>When picking out a water heater, pay attention to the energy efficiency rating of the models you're considering. You'll get several significant benefits from hiring a professional with experience for your water heater installation rather than trying it yourself if you haven't connected a water heater before.
