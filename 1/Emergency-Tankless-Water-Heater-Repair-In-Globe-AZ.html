<p>A tankless gas hot water heater can be complicated when it comes to piping and venting requirements. In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken. When the water on the top of the tank is hot, the top element turns off and the lower one heats.</p>

The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced.
