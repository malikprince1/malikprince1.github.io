Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
