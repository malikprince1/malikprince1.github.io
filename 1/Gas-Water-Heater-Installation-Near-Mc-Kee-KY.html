<h2>Water Heater Services Mc Kee Kentucky</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
