Before you buy, note the stem length required by your water heater model. How they work: Tankless systems heat your water on demand using gas or electric coils. They are also insulated to keep the water hot between heating cycles. It's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>The more people and the more simultaneous usage possibilities, the greater the GPM needs to be. One solution is to install multiple tankless units to meet the demands of a large household, but that can become very expensive.

<p>I refuse to repair an improperly installed unit as do most plumbers I know. PSE&G's WorryFree Replacement Service does include the replacement of water heaters. Choosing a tankless unit with the correct flow rate for your hot water needs can be confusing. There are many service calls in which we receive for recently installed hot water heating equipment that is not working as expected. Temperature adjustments: If your water is too hot or not hot enough, the thermostat on the unit may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Take a look at your hot water heater's temperature gauge. Tankless water heaters are just as they sound. With our regular water heater repair and maintenance services, we can extend the life of your system, reduce the risk for water leaks, and improve the control over your water temperature.

With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>Because water heaters are in constant contact with water, it's common for them to deteriorate over time. The overall cost of owning a water heater will depend on a number of factors such as the number of people using the heater, operating expenses, and remodeling done in the home. Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
