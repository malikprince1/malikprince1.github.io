<h2>Water Heater Services Billerica Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Free in-home estimates to replace your water heater. Before you purchase a water heater, it's also a good idea to estimate its annual operating costs and compare those costs with other less or more energy-efficient models. At a $180 yearly cost reduction, it will take 3.5 to 8 years to recover the additional expense and begin to save money. The fact that it costs significantly more to purchase and install is the only danger preventing everyone from enjoying the energy efficiency of a tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>This replaces the endless heating and cooling of gallons of water that a conventional tank water heater does throughout the day, which saves you from high energy costs and needing to limit how many people can shower at one time. For this reason, tankless systems are also called on-demand water heaters. At Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.

<p>If the heating element burns out, there's no heat to apply to the water. Once this occurs, it is necessary for a replacement to occur and to contact your local plumbing contractor. When sized appropriately, a constant supply of hot water is delivered to your home with ease. But you'll need to deal with pipes, gas lines or electrical. If your repairs are more frequent, it's better to put that money toward a new heater.</p>

Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
