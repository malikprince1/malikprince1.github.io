<h2>Water Heater Services Westminster South Carolina</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>3. If you are not getting the same hot water as you used to, then you probably need a new heater or to at least have it checked.

When you're enjoying quality family time, the last thing you need is a plumbing emergency.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system. No matter your reason for choosing a tankless version, you can rest assured that our fully licensed contractors have the knowledge, skills, and resources to complete your tankless water heater installation quickly and efficiently.</p>

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water.

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>Riley - There is a bit more to installing a tankless than a standard heater. If sediment or rust has built up in your water tank, it could be smothering or insulating the element.

Whether you use a traditional or a tankless water heater, you need to keep an eye out for mineral buildup inside your water heater.</p>
<p>Power venting a water heater costs about $500 to $1,000 more than a passive or direct vent system. By 2024, North America is expected to command more than 45% of the global tankless water heater market , according to Goldstein Research. Insulate the hot water pipe coming from the water heater. The reason that water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust is because it is not stored inside of the water heater.</p>
