<h2>Water Heater Services Prattville Alabama</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Free in-home estimates to replace your water heater. Before you purchase a water heater, it's also a good idea to estimate its annual operating costs and compare those costs with other less or more energy-efficient models.

The fact that it costs significantly more to purchase and install is the only danger preventing everyone from enjoying the energy efficiency of a tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>If your heater is in an inconvenient spot or a tight space, a tankless system might be able to help you out. It takes 60-70 minutes to heat a 100-gallon tank (recovery rate) with gas. Step 2.

This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>

The number of model choices can be overwhelming, but Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating takes the time to understand your needs and ensures that the water heater you select meets current city, state and national rules. Loud pops or cracks indicate that the heating element is failing and needs to be replaced.</p>

Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
