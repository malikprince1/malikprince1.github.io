<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused.

This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
