<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones.

<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta.

<p>The type of water heater you choose will depend on the type of hot water heating system in your home. When it's time to take a shower, run the dishwasher, or throw a load of clothes into the washing machine, a tankless water heater will quickly heat up the water you need. This is because they only heat water when there is a demand for it, rather than keeping a large amount of water heated at all times. Tanks with larger capacity or energy-efficiency upgrades cost more.</p>

<p>It's important to keep a separate store of water on hand just in case the public water pipes are damaged, broken or if your public water supply becomes contaminated. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run.

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>If your water heater is malfunctioning, give Assured Comfort a call. Providing nearly twice the service life and exceptional efficiency, tankless water heating adds value to the home. You need to be extra careful when you are handling gas, even though it is safe once it is installed, it has the ability to cause quite an amount of damage if not handled in a proper manner.
