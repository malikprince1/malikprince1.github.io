<p>How much will a new hot water heater cost you? The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use. Caccia, the third-generation plumber, says that once you make the switch, labor costs are less for replacing an old tankless water heater with a new one than for replacing an old storage tank with a new one.</p>
<p>Gas hot water system installation cost is typically between $250 and $700 to replace an old hot water system with the same type in the same spot. With a tankless water heater, there is no tank to heat up, so the supply of hot water is endless.

<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>

If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>
