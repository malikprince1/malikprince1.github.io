<h2>Water Heater Services Flatwoods Kentucky</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out. A broken unit can quickly leave you without any hot water, which is why it's good to know what warning signs to look for to get timely repair services. These replacement models have been designed to save on running costs by having no fixed pilot.</p>

The tankless gas models can be powered by electrical mains and you need to replace the batteries or the system is not otherwise reliable.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>Electric water heater: Connect the circuit wires to the water heater leads in the electrical junction box on the heater unit. A propane appliance like a hot water tank is a little less forgiving of problems than some of the larger built-in units you would find in most homes, so ensuring it is properly cleaned and maintained will help it last longer as well as keep you safer. In many cases it is a simple fix and does not require a new hot water heater.</p>

<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Next, your installer will mount the actual heating unit. For most households, the ideal hot water temperature is between 120 and 140 degrees. Instead of fighting over who gets the first shower in the morning, you don't have to worry about that with a new water heater. When you turn the hot water tap off the heat exchanger shuts down, saving energy and money. B&B Heating & Cooling are Homer Glen's tankless water heater specialists.</p>
