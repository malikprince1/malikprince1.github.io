Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>

Old water heaters aren't just inefficient, they are inconvenient. Fixed the tank less water heater.
