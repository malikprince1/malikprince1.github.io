<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater.
