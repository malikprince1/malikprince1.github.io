A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank. A water heater expansion tank is a must if your home runs on a closed water supply system. Water heater repair is what is required, hence get in touch with a plumber.

<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater.
