<h2>Water Heater Services Plymouth North Carolina</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Typically a 30-40 gallon heater is appropriate for a family of up to four, and a 50-80 gallon tank is appropriate if there are five or more people in the household. Pilot light on gas water heater flickers out. These particular Water Heaters are rapidly gaining in popularity and will soon become the standard. Our New Jersey plumbers can provide you with an honest assessment of your water heater to determine if the unit can still be repaired or if it's time for a replacement.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Replacement Plymouth</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>If there's too much scale buildup in the pipes, or faucet and showerhead aerators are clogged, or a turned-down faucet reduces water flow to about 0.3 gpm, these units automatically shut off. Heat Pump Water Heater: The energy factor of a heat pump water heater is more than twice the efficiency of a standard electric water heater. Can help you move into the future with a tankless water heater installation.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>How they work: Tank water heaters typically hold between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water (around 120 degrees Fahrenheit) in a storage tank. If the incoming water pressure is above 150 psi a pressure reducing valve must be installed upstream of the heater. Here are the biggest benefits of installing a tankless water heater in your home. These systems are capable of providing your home with unlimited hot water, all while lowering your energy bills.</p>
<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Plymouth NC</h3>
<p>Using a heating element, either electric or gas-powered, water passes into the unit and is immediately warmed to a set temperature. You will soon hear banging or rumbling sounds from your heater due to the obstruction inside the tank. New home construction is the best time to think about energy saving appliances like tankless hot water heaters, especially for gas heaters that require more home modification.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters. Traditional electric hot water heater tanks take up as much as 16 square feet of floor space in your home, but a tankless water heater is very compact and can be fixed on almost any wall either inside or outside your home.</p>
<p>In addition to installing your new tankless water heater, we offer tankless water heater replacement service. If it's a conventional storage-tank water heater nearing the end of its 10 to 13-year life, replacement is obvious: New models are up to 20% more efficient and can save up to $700 in energy costs over the life of the unit. The installation cost for a tankless water heater is usually between $1,470 and $2,500.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Plymouth North Carolina 27962</h3>
<p>Noritz has been an innovator in the water heating industry for over 60 years. This way the cold water can flow back to the heater through the cold water line. Mr. Electric service professionals are trained and experienced in installing tankless water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters come in three different types : non-condensing, condensing, non-condensing hybrid. By only heating water when it's needed, tankless water heaters do not experience standby heat loss, which occurs when heat escapes the water tank and needs constant reheating.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>You may also need to wire in the new water heater unless you're lucky enough to have a properly sized power source nearby. After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials. Next if your heater came with a T&P valve unbox it and pipe dope those threads.</p>
<p>If it's your water heater, a repair isn't an option. Tankless water heater installation costs may be less than you think. The main disadvantage of tankless water heaters is their upfront cost (unit and installation) is significantly higher than tank-style heaters. We have seen our fair share of bad thermostats, heating elements, and check valves. You can change a thermocouple on most water heaters with only a small adjustable wrench.</p>
<p>Whether you need water heater installation, repair, or replacement services, you can rely on our plumbing professionals for help. We highly recommend having your water heater installed by a professional as it is a difficult and sometimes dangerous process. That's why when it's time to equip your new home, or replace your old water heater it's important to consider cost, efficiency, and longevity of your new water heater.</p>
