<h2>Water Heater Services Rifle Colorado</h2>
<p>No matter how careful we are with our things, there comes a time when we need to replace them. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a bit more than a traditional storage tank water heater, but, tankless varieties last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before self-destructing, possibly flooding your basement or home, depending on their location If you want to hit a home run,” install a tankless water heater at each hot water outlet.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it. Unlike other water heaters, this type of water heater does not lose energy while in standby mode, allowing you to save more money over the long-term. Ferran Services is here to answer any question you might have, determine the perfect fit for your household, and provide proper installation.</p>
