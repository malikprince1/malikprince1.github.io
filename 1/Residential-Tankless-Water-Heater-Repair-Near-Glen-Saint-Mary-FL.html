<p>A backup heating element is in the tank, so you'll have plenty of hot water, no matter what the weather.

When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>
<p>A booster is a highly useful device that can help your small heater act like a larger one, and it can even save you energy and space in your home. The further away a fixture is from the water heater, the longer it takes for the water to heat up. There are other types of a tankless water heater and it is up to you to choose what is best for your whole house needs or commercial needs. You will get your hot water faster and the outlet temperature will be a little higher, so you use less hot and more cold when taking a shower.</p>
