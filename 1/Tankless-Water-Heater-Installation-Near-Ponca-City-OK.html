Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room).
