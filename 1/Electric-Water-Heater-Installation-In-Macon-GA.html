<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Macon</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to. This is probably because the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is malfunctioning. The most common complaint regarding a water heater is that it doesn't produce enough hot water. Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>
<p>Even if your family uses closer to 80 gallons of hot water daily, you can still enjoy 8% to 14% energy savings. Generally your first call for a balky water heater will be to a plumber, but if the plumber finds an electrical issue, you may need to call in a licensed electrician. Maintenance is the best way to make sure your water heater is in good condition, water heater maintenance isn't always something we think about doing.</p>
<p>First, we determine what type and size of water heater you need to meet your daily hot water needs. Once repaired, you may want to consider a maintenance plan on your hot water heater to make sure that you do not have future issues. Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are the newest and most important innovation in water heater technology. If your old water heater used copper piping and it was necessary to cut the pipes, you will need to prepare the pipes using sandpaper cloth.

<p>On Web sites featuring tankless water heater reviews, one can ask questions about the appliance and take advantage of the information provided. We specialize in tankless water heater replacement and new installations. If accessible, remove the cover plate from a gas heater tank. A tankless heats the water quickly, as it is needed. Here are two helpful videos that show how to troubleshoot an electric water heater that has no hot water.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater. When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem. If a professional plumber installed a closed system, it is unlikely that an expansion chamber or tank was not installed at the same time. At Gold Medal Service, we are committed to doing everything we can to restore your water heater to optimal performance.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>That's where tankless, often called on-demand,” water heaters come in. You can get a low-end 50-gallon tank water heater for around $500 but a top-of-the-line Rinnai or Navien may cost around $1,500. Your water heater does not supply hot water constantly. With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>And while they cost more than electric-only models, installation is similar and payback time is short. The water heater replenishes supply following use of the stored hot water in the tank. Tankless coil and indirect water heaters - Indirect hot water heaters use the home's space heating system to heat water. Unlimited Hot Water: A traditional water heater will eventually run out of hot water and only work once the tank is refilled.</p>
