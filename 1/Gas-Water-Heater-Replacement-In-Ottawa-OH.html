This also goes for replacing an old water heater. We offer quick same day service and stock most common water heater parts.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Ottawa</h3>
<p>Homeowners looking to save on water heating expenses. Most gas tankless water heaters fall between 95,000-195,000 BTUs. Now though, if you need to repair or replace your heater, both Morco and Bosch have ceased production of these models.
