Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>

<p>When you turn on a hot water faucet for the first time in a few hours, you may find yourself waiting impatiently for 30 seconds or more for the water to heat up. Once it starts coming out hot, it stays that way for a while. It is virtually impossible to repair a leaking hot water heater.

Our comfort advisors would be happy to discuss your new-build plans, assess your family's water heating needs, and help you make an informed decision about whether or not a tankless water heater installation would be right for your home.

<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Mount Olive NC</h3>
<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of time before your water heater will need to be replaced and it is always better to schedule it out than deal with an untimely breakdown. Replacing your hot water tank can be a costly venture. In comparison, the average life expectancy of an electric tank water heater is about 12 or 13 years. If you have a bulky storage model that seems to be guzzling electricity or gas then you should replace it with the latest tankless direct vent gas version as this can enable you to save around 10% to 30% in your energy bills.</p>

<p>Enjoy reliable water heater servicing and protection with Miracle Plumbing Inc. We have many years of experience working on all types of hot water heaters. Besides sizing the unit appropriately, I'll want to know what the manufacturer's minimum flow rate is, what type of water quality is required by the manufacturer, and exactly what the warranty covers. With a tank heater, water sits for long periods of time, and this can corrode heating elements, the inside of the tank, and the bottom often fills with sediment.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>

Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
