<h2>Water Heater Services Perry Oklahoma</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet. The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes. Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater will cost $1,950 installed.
