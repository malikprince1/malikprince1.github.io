<h2>Water Heater Services Grayslake Illinois</h2>
<p>The plumbing system is a vital part of the home which requires care to keep it functioning properly. Getting an oversized heater is a waste of money; while heaters with too low capacity will not supply sufficient hot water. The plumbers at Ben Franklin Levittown can also recommend the precise replacement heater needed for your water heater based on how many people live in your home within the budget you set. Our specialists can install, repair, tune-up, or replace any hot water heater. This saves energy, but could also waste water.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters are cheaper than the gas versions. Save more with exclusive offers and valuable coupons from Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning. If you have a gas water heater make certain the gas is off and pilot light is not on before you do anything. Never attempt to repair or replace your water heater yourself.

Today's plumbing code requires all tank-style water heaters to have a temperature and pressure relief valve that opens to release pressure and eliminate the possibility of the tank exploding. Traditional water heaters are easier and less costly to install, but they do cost more to run.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Installation Grayslake</h3>
<p>Avoid ice cold showers and keep your water heater functioning properly. We have a variety of options for you including high-efficiency water heaters, electric water heaters, gas water heaters and tankless water heaters. Heaters produce heat, and that heat can cause a fire if not handled properly. Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand, so regardless of household usage, you save money, energy and reduce waste by only heating water when you need it.</p>
<p>If your water heater is approaching the ten-year mark, it's time to start considering replacement services. For commercial facilities including hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a huge impact on daily operations and must be avoided whenever possible. This type of heater can serve a virtually limitless source of hot water, because it's always heating a large amount of water.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>As with any home repair project, water heater replacement is largely dependent on the individual characteristics of the home in which it is being installed.

<p>Because tankless water heaters draw water from your main water line only as you need it, there is no possibility of flooding from this kind of system. The only higher percentage is heating and cooling costs. One of the lesser-known downsides of tankless water heaters is that they have difficulty achieving a lukewarm water temperature. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time might stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>

<p>If electric you will probably need 220 volt service run to the location where the unit will be installed, which can also be some what expensive. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas inside the premises, it is an emergency situation, you need to call water heaters repair services urgently. That means you will always get 120° water from your hot faucet when you turn it on, until the tank begins to replenish the tank from the cold water source.</p>

<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
