<p>Tankless water heaters are a relatively new entrant into the market, but they work quite well for most homeowners. This is true, but, like all man made things, at times, the heater might simply refuse to supply hot water. More Hot Water: Newer water heaters are able to provide you with more hot water. Check the literature for the brand heater you are considering and find the output in gallons per minute (GPM) at the temperature rise you need.</p>

The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
