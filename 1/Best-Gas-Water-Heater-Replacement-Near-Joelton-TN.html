To heat this water to the required temperature for a hot shower or bath will take a lot more energy than heating warmer water. Hot Water Heater Installed. Point-of-use tankless heaters that go under sinks, near showers, or near washing machines can also be great options for those who live in tiny homes or RVs. These heaters have an average life of 20 years and have no problems related to hard water since there is no water storage.</p>

They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
