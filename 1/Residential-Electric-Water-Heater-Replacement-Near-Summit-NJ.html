<p>One modern day luxury that we often take for granted is the ability to have a hot bath or shower at the flick of a water faucet. But if you use hot water only in the morning and in the evening, like most full time working people do, your energy bill will go down substantially.

For this reason, installation costs will vary based on a home's floor plan and how far the piping needs to be directed through the house.</p>

Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>
