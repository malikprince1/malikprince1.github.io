<h2>Water Heater Services Saint Simons Island Georgia</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>
