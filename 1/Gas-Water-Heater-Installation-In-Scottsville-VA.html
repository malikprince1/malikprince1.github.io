Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale.
