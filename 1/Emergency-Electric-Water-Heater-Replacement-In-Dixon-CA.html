<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>
