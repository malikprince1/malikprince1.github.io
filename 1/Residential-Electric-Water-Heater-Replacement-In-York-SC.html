<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>

With a tankless unit in place, you can rest assured knowing the system will provide clean and fresh water to your faucets. Most standard tankless water heaters have a lifespan of up to 20 years when properly maintained. Discolored water observed when hot water is coming out of your faucet, is a sign of excess scale built up inside your heater tank.</p>
