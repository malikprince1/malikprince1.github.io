<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters. Since the tank is the only part of the system that can actually force you to replace the water heater, be sure to troubleshoot before you buy a new unit. There is also a range of fuel sources that can heat water such as solar, gas, electricity and wood. Also known as instantaneous water heater, the heater heats the water on demand.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine. Because tankless heaters do not store water, they are less subject to corrosion than tank-type heaters. All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical has all your water heater services covered.</p>
<p>Who should buy a tank water heater: If you have a timeline or budget constraints that prevent you from getting a tankless system, a tank heater may be the way to go.

The average household capacity is around 200 amps, which may not be enough to support a tankless electric heater. Tankless hot water heaters are available in propane (LP), natural gas, or electric models.</p>

In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
