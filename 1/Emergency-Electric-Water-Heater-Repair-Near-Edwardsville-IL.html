<h2>Water Heater Services Edwardsville Illinois</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries. A tankless water heater will last about twenty(20) years, while a conventional water heater may only last ten(10) to thirteen(13) years or less (depending on the quality of your water). He quickly identified the issue (lower heating element not working) and explained the situation (very old water heater) and my options to address in a very easy to understand manner.</p>

While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>
