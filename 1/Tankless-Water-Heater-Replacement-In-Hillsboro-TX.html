<h2>Water Heater Services Hillsboro Texas</h2>
<p>While the process of installing a tankless water heater isn't too difficult it is very different from the process of installing a standard tank water heater.

Electric water heater: Confirm that the circuit is off to the water heater, using a non-contact voltage tester, then disconnect the wiring connections and circuit cable from the water heater.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>The voltage of most heaters range between 110V to 277V. This could happen at the top or bottom of the water heater, where the pipes come out. However, if your water looks rusty, has a funky smell, or produces a strange noise, it's time to call a professional for a hot water heater repair.
