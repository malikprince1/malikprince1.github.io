<h2>Water Heater Services Kansas City Kansas</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters (such as demand-type water heaters and tankless coil water heaters) prevent standby heat losses. When you multiply that usage by each household member, the demands placed on the water heater is brought into perspective. Small families and studio apartments can often use a 20 gallon electric or tankless water heater (if the apartments are on individual units). When it comes to water heaters, repair isn't always the most cost-effective option.</p>
