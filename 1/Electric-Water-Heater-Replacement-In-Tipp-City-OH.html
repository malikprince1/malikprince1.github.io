Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>

Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust.
