<h2>Water Heater Services Marco Island Florida</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will meet your needs and conserve energy. This means that you might need a larger unit or multiple units if you have a simultaneous demand from multiple showers, faucets, or other hot water consumers like a washing machine. At Care Temp, LLC, we install and repair standard and tankless water heaters in Toms River, NJ, as well as in Brick, Jackson, Manchester, Lakewood, and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

Traditional tank water heaters keep large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at once. That said, the tankless system may qualify for state or federal tax rebates for energy-efficient appliances.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage.
