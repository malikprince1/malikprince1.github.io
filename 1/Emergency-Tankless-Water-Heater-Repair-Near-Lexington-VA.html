Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>If you already have a tankless water heater, we can also perform necessary repairs and maintenance. Tankless hot water heater replacement estimates cannot be given over the phone.
