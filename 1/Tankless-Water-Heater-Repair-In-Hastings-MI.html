<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>

For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
