There are certainly pros and cons to both types of hot water heaters. For every BTU input of gas to the heater, there needs to be enough air in the room to assure that the combustion chamber of the heater breathes freely.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it. Unlike other water heaters, this type of water heater does not lose energy while in standby mode, allowing you to save more money over the long-term. Ferran Services is here to answer any question you might have, determine the perfect fit for your household, and provide proper installation.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Replacement West Linn</h3>
<p>Avoid ice cold showers and keep your water heater functioning properly. We have a variety of options for you including high-efficiency water heaters, electric water heaters, gas water heaters and tankless water heaters. Heaters produce heat, and that heat can cause a fire if not handled properly. Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand, so regardless of household usage, you save money, energy and reduce waste by only heating water when you need it.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>The power vent systems only need an exhaust vent, and the unit has to be installed in a location that provides the right amount of air required for combustion to take place. We'll provide basic information about some of your options by taking a look at two types of ENERGY STAR-qualified water heaters : high-efficiency gas storage and whole-home gas tankless.

<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>

<p>Therefore, if water is leaking directly from the tank, it's time to replace your water heater. A tankless heater can supply no more than its flow rate, typically 2 to 5 gallons per minute. Having been the industry standard for home hot water, you're likely quite familiar with a tank water heater. Unlike conventional water heaters, there is no backup hot water source during these emergency situations. In addition to removing the old unit and disposing of it safely, Roto-Rooter's water heater experts can ensure that gas, electrical, and other connections are handled safely and the water heater is installed properly.</p>

We have seen our fair share of bad thermostats, heating elements, and check valves. You can change a thermocouple on most water heaters with only a small adjustable wrench.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some new code requirements have changed since your w. heater was first installed.
