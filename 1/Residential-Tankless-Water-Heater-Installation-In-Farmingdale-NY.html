Many times, the handyman of the family will see a new hot water heater or a tankless hot water heater in the household supply stores. A huge puddle of water all over your basement floor and it is coming from the bottom of the water heater. Keep the drain valve in the front as best as you can to easily drain out water later on in the water heater's life.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>When it comes to installation, manufacturers recommend that you have a professional plumbing contractor help you with this process. And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used.
