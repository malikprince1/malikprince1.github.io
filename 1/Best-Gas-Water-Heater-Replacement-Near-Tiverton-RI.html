<h2>Water Heater Services Tiverton Rhode Island</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>When a homeowner is unhappy with a tankless water heater, it usually concerns the issues above, and managing expectations about how their tankless water heater should perform. Before you buy, note the stem length required by your water heater model. How they work: Tankless systems heat your water on demand using gas or electric coils. They are also insulated to keep the water hot between heating cycles. It's time to replace your unit.</p>

<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Replacement Tiverton</h3>
<p>With a tankless water heater, you will never run out of hot water due to the way the water is heated. We offer fast, same day service and will send a trained professional to your home or business and do our best to ensure that you have hot water again as quickly as possible. Traditional tank water heaters are sold clearly marked with their capacity in gallons on a label on the tank. Propane costs an average of $350 per year to run a heater.</p>
<p>It only needs enough power to heat the amount of water needed at the time. A water heater is not only useful for your bath but also for your laundry, dishwashing etc. Replacement of a traditional water tank is usually needed because of the build-up of scale and rust on the inside of the tank. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. While traditional water heaters maintain a constant supply of hot water for your use, a tankless unit heats water quickly on demand.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, your hot water heater can explode and cause significant damages. Your traditional tank heater provides you with hot water after having to heat the entire tank's capacity - between 30 and 50 gallons.

Note: All plumbing installations must conform to the local plumbing code, so consult the local building department for requirements in your area.</p>

<p>In addition to providing expert tankless water heater repairs, we also specialize in installations and replacements. Other materials, including heat pumps and pipes, are not included in standard installation costs. In locations where water has a high mineral content, otherwise known as hard water, add a water softener to reduce the unwanted effects that those mineral deposits can have on the water heater tank.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections.
