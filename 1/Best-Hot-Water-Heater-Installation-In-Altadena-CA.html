A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>

The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
