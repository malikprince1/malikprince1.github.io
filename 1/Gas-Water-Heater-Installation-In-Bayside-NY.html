<p>Indirect water heaters use heat from a boiler. Radiant heating is a type of heating setup where the heat is supplied by electric wiring or hot water tubes installed into or under the flooring, and sometimes walls and ceilings.

<p>While traditional water heaters will typically have a lifespan of anywhere between ten and fifteen years, most tankless units can be expected to be in use for over twenty years.

The answer is when it has started leaking.</p>

With tankless heaters you have the benefit of an endless supply of hot water. A tankless water heater is less likely to corrode than a storage tank system, but if the pipes start to leak, corrosion can start up. If the corrosion develops too far, the whole system may need to be replaced.</p>
<p>When replacing a storage tank heater, the existing venting is often galvanized sheet metal that can oxidize or rust over a long period of time, if condensation collects inside it. The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
<p>Depending on your tankless water heater's capacity, too many simultaneous hot water applications (such as multiple showers running) can overload your water heater. Yes, one of the main reasons we get called out to a customer's house is their water heater has broken down and isn't supplying hot water anymore. This isn't an issue with tankless water heaters.
