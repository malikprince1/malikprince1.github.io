<h2>Water Heater Services Flagstaff Arizona</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>If your heater is in an inconvenient spot or a tight space, a tankless system might be able to help you out. It takes 60-70 minutes to heat a 100-gallon tank (recovery rate) with gas. Step 2. Turn off the gas going to the water heater at the valve that connects to the front of the water heater. According to HomeAdvisor , it can take up to 20 years for your tankless heater to pay for itself with energy bill savings.</p>

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster.

Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
