<h2>Water Heater Services New Rochelle New York</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work.

Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
