<p>Repair guides and support for gas and electric hot water tanks, boilers and household heat exchangers. With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks.

A new energy-efficient water heater will help save you some money in energy costs each month.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker.

<p>Just as soon as the overall temperature drops, the thermostat signals the heating element to work. Replacing your water heater can ultimately lead to saving you time, money and stress down the road.

A propane appliance like a hot water tank is a little less forgiving of problems than some of the larger built-in units you would find in most homes, so ensuring it is properly cleaned and maintained will help it last longer as well as keep you safer.
