When sized appropriately, a constant supply of hot water is delivered to your home with ease. But you'll need to deal with pipes, gas lines or electrical.

By combining these costs over a pre-determined period of time, we are able to understand and compare the total cost of ownership. If the TP valve or outlet pipe is cold, the water heater hasn't been working for several hours.

On the other hand, if you have a non-leaking water heater and no hot water, you can often correct that yourself without calling a plumber. What's more, there are certainly cost savings to replacing all traditional water heaters with tankless water heaters at the same time.</p>
