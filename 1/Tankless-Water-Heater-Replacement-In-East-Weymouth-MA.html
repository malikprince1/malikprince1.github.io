<h2>Water Heater Services East Weymouth Massachusetts</h2>
<p>A tankless water heater provides water as it is needed. This saves you from needing to drain the entire water heater. While it's usually recommended to stick with a gas water heater if you're concerned about energy costs, it is possible to switch from a gas to an electric water heater in Las Vegas. We have a comprehensive selection of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in multiple sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation. Sure, I said it wasn't the only reason to make the change, but solar heaters are undoubtedly a wonderful green choice.</p>

The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house.
