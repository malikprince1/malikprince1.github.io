<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Thomas Kentucky</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>Call an electric water heater repair person. If you are wanting to get a new water heater before a replacement is needed or you are wanting to upgrade to a new water heater, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are here to help you. Switching from a tank water heater to a tankless unit can be expensive because it requires you to retrofit your plumbing and possibly your electrical system. Tip: Routine upkeep on your water heater is a good idea.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Tankless gas models need to produce very high combustion temperatures so that they can instantaneously raise the temperature of incoming cold water to the desired temperature.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Installation Fort Thomas</h3>
<p>The tankless technology reduces homes energy consumption and lowers your energy bills as well. If your bank account can manage the higher initial cost of a tankless water heater, you'll save more money over time by choosing tankless. Open the water valves but not the electricity or gas. The type of water heater you choose directly affects your water heating costs. If you've had issues with hot water supply for as long as you've had the heater, your water heater's tank might not be big enough to supply the hot water you need.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>First, we determine what type and size of water heater you need to meet your daily hot water needs. Once repaired, you may want to consider a maintenance plan on your hot water heater to make sure that you do not have future issues. Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>
<p>Replaced two 50 gallon electric water heater and thermal expansion tank. Our plumbers work with both standard and tankless water heaters, and we can help you with your water heater problems—no matter what they are. Drain the water heater twice a year. Installation of a thermal expansion tank: If your water heater experiences regular leaks, your home's water pressure might be too much for it to handle. If well-maintained and of good quality, a hot water heater should last around a decade, give or take a couple of years.</p>
<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Fort Thomas KY</h3>
<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>We are also available for gas line repair , as another common issue with tankless systems is their power supply. Tankless water heater installation needs will vary from your standard water heater. Stay on top of these simple maintenance tasks and you can avoid thinking about water heaters again for a long time. Check out our in-depth tank water heater repair article here. They really are more efficient and as long as you don't start taking super long showers a tankless should save you money.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Fort Thomas Kentucky 41075</h3>
<p>To avoid flooding from tank failure, Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating offers alarm and cold water shut-off valve options. Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Tankless gas heaters don't store water and so you don't pay to keep gallons of water at a high temperature as in the tanks of electric hot water heaters. When you're dealing with a broken water heater, AC unit, or some other indoor comfort issue, you want to make sure the company you call will work with you to fix it, and not just provide a service to mask the real problem. Whether you're looking for a more efficient water heating system or simply need help repairing your current water heater, you are sure to get professional help from us. Visit our coupons page to check our current plumbing specials.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters supply hot water when you need it without the use of a storage tank. The main differences include that a direct vent heater uses an inducer motor to boost the removal of exhaust gas and can be vented with PVC pipe. Internal corrosions is most likely occurring in your water heater and it's time to consider replacing it with a more efficient, modern model. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>Electric tankless hot water installation can similarly run into a variety of problems if it is not wired by professionals. A tankless water heater is a system of heating your household water that doesn't require the standard water tank of a traditional system. Your water heater is one of the most important parts of your home. Heater Size: If your unit is too small, it will not be able to heat water efficiently.</p>
