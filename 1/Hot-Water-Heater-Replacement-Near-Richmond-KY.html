<p>Because hot water is essential to our everyday lives, it is important to manage and maintain your hot water heater. Tankless heaters do not have a large standing water supply, instead they instantly heat the water to the necessary temperature as it is required. Hybrid electric heat pump water heaters don't work well in very cold spaces.

<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Richmond KY</h3>
<p>The size of the openings for combustion air — from indoors or outdoors — is based upon the tankless unit's Btu input. Tankless water heaters for RVs are becoming increasingly popular specifically for this. I was impressed the first time that I saw a tankless water heater. Even if you have an existing gas line, it may need to be upgraded to a bigger pipe in order to accommodate the power needed to fuel the tankless unit.</p>
<p>If you have the wrong pipe or electrical fittings you will have to return to the hardware store causing delays of the installation process. If you can and choose to do the job yourself, you should know how to shut off the water to your house (see How to Shut Off the Water to Fixtures ) and how to cut into and connect new fittings and pipes to your supply pipes (if you have copper pipes, see Cutting & Joining Copper Pipe ).</p>
<p>Whether your drain is slow moving or your water has a rusty color, know that you can turn to Gold Medal Service for top quality plumbing services.
