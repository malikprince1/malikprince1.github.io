A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>

Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000.
