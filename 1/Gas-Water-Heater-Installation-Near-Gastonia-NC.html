Tank-type water heaters consume energy on an ongoing basis to keep water hot in a tank. Sizing a regular tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. Logic suggests that if you pay to heat water only at those peak times, it must cost less than heating water all the time. After you have had your unit looked at by the specialist, they will probably suggest that you either repair or replace your heater.</p>

When it's time to take a shower, run the dishwasher, or throw a load of clothes into the washing machine, a tankless water heater will quickly heat up the water you need.

<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained.

Electric water heaters tend to only last 8 to 10 years before they need to be replaced.</p>
