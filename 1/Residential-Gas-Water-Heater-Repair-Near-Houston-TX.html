<h2>Water Heater Services Houston Texas</h2>
<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water.

In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage.
