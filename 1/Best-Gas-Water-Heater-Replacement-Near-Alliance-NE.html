<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Alliance</h3>
<p>However, this problem can be quickly fixed by installing two or more tankless water heaters and connecting them in parallel. You will immediately be able to decrease the amount of energy that you use in your home by installing a tankless water heater. If a replacement of a water heater is essential, our water heater experts will help you determine which sort of solution is right for your home and within your budget, considering your family's water heating needs and energy usage expectations.</p>
<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types. For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
<p>In such cases, our Thousand Oaks water heater repair professionals will explain to you why replacing your old water heater will be cheaper in the long run than repairing it time and time again. Our technicians have specialized training in tankless systems, which means we can address the areas of installation, repair, and replacement with equal confidence. Gas fired tankless systems produce hot water at a higher flow rate than electric tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>It's measured in Gallons Per Minute or GPM, the higher the GPG, the more water can be heated at the same time. In a large home, or if you have a big family and heavy water usage, you may need to install two or more tankless models. The main factor is the cost of the water heater itself. If you run a business whose core operations depend on providing the customers with hot water as part of the experience, going tankless is a necessity that directly connects to the bottom line.</p>

<p>Additional materials: some of the tankless systems will also be incompatible with the location and setup of older storage tank models. Many, like Navien tankless water heaters, qualify for energy efficiency rebates and credits from local utility companies because they are certified Energy Star products. Further, some gas condensate tanks cost almost three times as much as a traditional gas storage tank.

<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>You will need to know what voltage your water heater is. While is seems like common sense to tell you, make sure you turn off the circuit breakers if you will be installing any electrical connections. Once you're set on your tankless water heater installation, your plumber will arrive within a week, review the process with you, and get to work. After years of tankless water heater installs, we've found that some consumers have expectations, realistic or otherwise, that should be addressed before deciding to go tankless.</p>
<p>It's much more convenient to shop for a replacement water heater around the 10-year or 15-year mark, depending on what type of water heater you have. No need to worry, give us a call right away and we can find the solution to any of your issues with your water heater. Speaking of, you should absolutely have your new tankless water heater installed by a professional.
