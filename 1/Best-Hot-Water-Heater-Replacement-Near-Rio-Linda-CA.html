<p>If it's time for a replacement, we will help you determine the best option according to the design of your home and your family's needs and budget. As opposed to storage tank water heaters, which maintain a large tank of hot water at all times, tankless water heaters only heat the water you need. Save Energy - Tankless heaters only use energy as needed, instead of continuously using energy all day. We have an excellent selection of tank and tankless models that meet the government's energy-efficiency standards.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
<p>The type of water heater you choose will depend on the type of hot water heating system in your home. When it's time to take a shower, run the dishwasher, or throw a load of clothes into the washing machine, a tankless water heater will quickly heat up the water you need. This is because they only heat water when there is a demand for it, rather than keeping a large amount of water heated at all times. Tanks with larger capacity or energy-efficiency upgrades cost more.</p>

However, there are levels among tankless heaters as gas-fired heaters are able to produce higher flow rates than electric models.</p>
