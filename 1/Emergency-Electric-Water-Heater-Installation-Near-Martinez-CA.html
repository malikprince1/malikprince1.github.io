If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation.

Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

A tankless gas water heater lasts around 20 years, while a traditional gas water heater lasts about 15. New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>
<p>It only heats water when you are calling for hot water and heats only in the amount that you need. Ninety degree bend on the top could be an obstacle for the venting, so it's good if there is much vertical rise at the top of the heater, as this allows the exhaust gas to easily emit out. Roto-Rooter plumbers are experts at water heater leak repair. However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>
<p>Another obvious indicator is if the water you get is close to cold as ice, then your water heating device has already reached its maximum level of service.

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
<p>When you turn on a hot water tap in your home, either a gas burner or an electric element directly heats the cold water that travels through a pipe into the unit.

<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>If your instant hot water heater is struggling to maintain or reach your set temperature, an inspection is warranted. Furthermore, the installation must comply with all national, state and local electrical and plumbing codes. One of the best ways to save on plumbing maintenance is to invest in a maintenance service agreement Whether you need HVAC or plumbing services, all plans include 7-day, 24-hour emergency service.</p>

With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>The non-condensing design uses a primary heat exchanger to heat water, which creates hot exhaust and the necessity to install an expensive vent. Rheem tankless water heaters are available at Home Depot. Heil Plumbing installs and repairs water heaters for residential and commercial projects in Columbia, Maryland and throughout Howard County, as well as the Towson area.
