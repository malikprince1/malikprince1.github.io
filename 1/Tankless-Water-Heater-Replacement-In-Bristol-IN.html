<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.

<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Many people are going towards getting tankless water heat so that they do not need to keep it maintained of another appliance.
