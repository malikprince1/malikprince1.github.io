<h2>Water Heater Services Summerfield North Carolina</h2>
<p>Many consumers are choosing to upgrade their current tank water heater to the new and improved tankless water heater systems that are available. We provide everything from hot water tank replacement to water heater maintenance. I called and the very next day they came out and repaired my heating service and did an excellent job. As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose. While tankless water heaters are a great alternative to traditional tank water heaters, there are some things to consider before you purchase and allow Barstow and Sons to install them professionally. As with any other appliance or component of your home, proper maintenance is essential to maximize the lifespan of your water heater.</p>
<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>

In most cases, people who get combination space and water heating systems are doing new construction, but you can also retrofit these units with existing sources for heating water.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>Pick the water heater that best fits your water usage, lifestyle situation, and budget. When you are not using hot water, the heater's internal sensor automatically switches off the heat exchanger. However, installation costs are lower owing the absence of a furnace. The gas hot water heater should utilize a removable anode which helps to prevent chemical reactions between the chemicals present in the tank which may cause erosion.</p>

Assured Comfort repairs and services all brands of residential and commercial hot water heaters. Gas water heater: Confirm that the gas supply is shut off at the shutoff valves, then disconnect the gas line to the water heater.

<p>Energy efficiencies between the different types of burners on the tank water heaters can differ greatly. Traditional water heaters cost less than tankless or heat pump water heaters - it's one reason why they're the most popular choice among Atlanta homeowners.

<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company.
