Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
