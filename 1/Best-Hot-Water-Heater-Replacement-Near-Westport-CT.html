<h2>Water Heater Services Westport Connecticut</h2>
<p>Your water heater is one of the single most expensive components of your plumbing system. Typically, Houston water heater tanks are made of steel and lined with glass to prevent the steel from rusting. We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Westport</h3>
<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>If your water heater is approaching the ten-year mark, it's time to start considering replacement services. For commercial facilities including hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a huge impact on daily operations and must be avoided whenever possible. This type of heater can serve a virtually limitless source of hot water, because it's always heating a large amount of water.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>At Premier Plumbing we help you make the right decision based your needs so you know that the water heater you buy is the right one for your home or business at the lowest cost possible. Water heaters can break and leak for various reasons but some of the main problems are the water pressure is too high, a loose drain valve, wear and tear.

<p>According to , an Energy Star tankless water heaters can save you about $100 annually. You should choose a system that will not only provide enough hot water for your entire family's needs, but also one that will be energy efficient. Tip: Look closely at the temperature knob on your water heater and look for the word "vacation." If you are gone for more than five days, turn the water heater setting to "vacation" which means your water and your heating bill will be getting some rest while you are away.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating systems effectively cancels out the standby heat losses made by storage type heaters. However, in that 30 plus year span, it has been determined that tankless water heaters can be expected to last for 20 years or more with minimal care and maintenance being required. While these units will similarly fuel your system, the main differences occur in operating cost. Plumbers are pros at fitting pipes and stopping leaks, but that doesn't mean they can troubleshoot electrical problems, adjust gas pressures, or monitor combustion safety.</p>

We are one of the area's most trusted resources for home comfort and plumbing needs, including water heaters, and we can quickly address your problem and install a new water heater for you.

There are many circumstances where a tankless water heater would be of great benefit for a busy household.</p>
<p>It will also take a long time for the water you need to heat up, since it only starts to do so when you turn on a tap. While the water heater is filling up leave the faucets on so you can bleed all of the air out of the system. The main companies producing such heaters are Bosch, Rheum and Noritz. Tankless water heaters generally require a higher initial investment, but they are less costly to operate and provide additional benefits like endless hot water.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust. Beehive Plumbing has the necessary experience and tools to handle all water heater repair, whether they're commercial or residential.</p>
