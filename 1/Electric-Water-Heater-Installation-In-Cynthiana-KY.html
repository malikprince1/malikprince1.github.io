<h2>Water Heater Services Cynthiana Kentucky</h2>
<p>For both traditional and tankless water heaters, the thermostat is one of the most frequent culprits when it comes to malfunctions. Hold the hot water heater against the desired wall. For the ultimate in tank water heater power, but with the efficiency of a tankless system, a hybrid water heater makes an excellent solution. If you're not totally happy with our installation work the first time, we'll redo the job on our own dime. The points above show the benefits of installing tankless hot water heater. Doctor Fix it installs all makes and models of water heaters, and can also educate you about the benefits of Tankless Water Heaters as another option for endless hot water.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem. If your electric water heater isn't working the first thing to do is check your breaker or fuse box. Furthermore, tankless systems last nearly twice as long as traditional water heaters - up to 20 years or more.</p>

<p>You'll also save in repair and maintenance costs, as well, because tankless units tend to have fewer problems like leaks. If water comes out of the faucet with a brown, yellow, or red tint, there could be rust occurring inside your water heater tank or the pipes in your home. For all your residential tank and tankless water heater needs from minor repairs to complete replacement. Because it is a direct route, air in the space also gets lead to the exterior when the gas heater is not working.</p>
<p>The easiest way to brace a water heater is to install a pre-approved bracing system, which is available at most hardware stores.

<p>With a tankless system, you have unlimited hot water since the water is being heated on the fly and not from a stored container. With a tankless water heater, San Diego residents can enjoy up to a 40 percent energy savings on their SDG&E bill compared to a traditional model. The tankless system avoids this and provides you with peace-of-mind knowing that you don't have a potential hydro-time-bomb in your utility closet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gas or propane fueled tankless water heaters have better power efficient but more complex installation process. A tankless water heater system operates by using a line or pipe. Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models).

<h3>Water Tank Repair Cynthiana Kentucky 41031</h3>
<p>Whether we simply need to replace a broken part, remove excess sediment, repair the heating element, or do something else entirely, we'll make safety our priority. You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting. Answers to this issue are turning up the heat dial on the water heater, insulating the hot water pipes, moving the water heater, installing a second water heater or adding a recirculating pump system.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM. So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>
<p>Less efficiency — the heater will have to use more gas or electricity to heat the water. The first is that the tankless water heater that you install must have a thermal efficiency that's greater than 90%.

Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
