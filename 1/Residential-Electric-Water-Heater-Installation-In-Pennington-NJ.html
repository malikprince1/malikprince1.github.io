Now though, if you need to repair or replace your heater, both Morco and Bosch have ceased production of these models. A standard water heater has to keep a constant supply of heat to the water inside the tank in order to have it at the right temperature when you need to take a hot shower or wash the dishes.</p>

<p>So some basic knowledge will allow you to troubleshoot water heaters of almost any age or manufacturer. They need a larger volume of water in order to provide a constant and convenient water temperature. Find the cold water line on top of the water heater and turn the gate valve off. All water heaters are required to have a temperature pressure release valve installed to release any excessive pressure that is built up inside the tank.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan.
