Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair. It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing.
