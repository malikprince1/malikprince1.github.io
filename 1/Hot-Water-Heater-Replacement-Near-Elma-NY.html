<h2>Water Heater Services Elma New York</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>There are many components to a gas or electric water heater that may require adjustment to restore hot water to your home. The average water heater has a lifespan of 12 years. But those perks may not be enough for some people to offset the extra purchase cost and installation expense. Electric tankless products do work in cold climates. If you have a small drip or a leak coming out of your water heater, it's very important to get a plumber over right away.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement.

<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
