<h2>Water Heater Services Methuen Massachusetts</h2>

However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement.

If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on. If the pilot isn't lit the gas valve won't turn the gas on. When a hot water tap is turned on, water enters the tankless water heater.</p>
<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Methuen MA</h3>
<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>There are minor repairs that you can attempt for yourself if you know how to repair a water heating appliance. If these water heaters function in a cool environment (location), they'll work harder in the winter months, driving your gas or electric bills even higher during the cold winter. The temperature set on the control determines how hot the coils become, how quickly the water moves across the coils, and how hot the water will be when it comes out of the tap.</p>
<p>By installing it as a point of use water heater, you will get instant hot water as soon as you turn on the faucet. Generally, gas powered tankless water heaters heat water up at a slightly higher rate compared to electric powered ones. Alternatively, in an electric setup there is only a water storage tank, two heating elements and a thermostat control. They came right on time, discussed the options and proceeded to repair our water heater for far less than a new one.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Methuen Massachusetts 01844</h3>
<p>Your water heater would routinely be splashed with water or other liquids. Note: Our Customer Service Professionals are happy to help you determine this information over the phone if you are unable to find the specifications on your current water heater. Gas hot water problems or electric hot water heater problems can sometimes be easily fixed. A small, air-source heat pump installed on top of the hot water storage tank pumps hot, pressurized refrigerant compound into a heat exchanger located in or around the hot water tank.</p>
<p>In addition to the upfront cost, which carries significant weight in the decision for many, other factors also include the number of people in the house, any remodeling in the home, as well as the expense to operate the heater. If you see a dip in water pressure whenever you turn on your hot water, there may be some damage to the plumbing lines. We are a family-owned business that provides exceptional water heater services to Cumming, Georgia, and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Instead, the water is heated when it passes through the system, which may be fuelled by gas or electricity. Typical home water heaters are the large storage types that take up a significant amount of room in the garage or basement. After a while fixing a leak-prone water heater can become costly. Our plumbers know that this can be stressful, but we are here to offer quick and effective water heater replacement service for your home or business.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will not cause damage if there is a leak, you can wait until it develops a leak before replacing it, but that really is not recommended. The amount you pay for service goes towards your replacement. In addition, we are trained to repair and install commercial tankless water heater and commercial water heater systems. Luckily, hot water heaters are fairly simple and don't have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
