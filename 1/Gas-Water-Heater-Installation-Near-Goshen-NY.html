<h3>Water Tank Repair Goshen New York 10924</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>At Bill Howe Plumbing, we love tankless water heaters. Another option is to investigate solar power, supplemented by an energy efficient water heater tank powered by gas or electricity.
