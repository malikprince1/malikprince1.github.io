<p>Do you need water heater repair for your gas system? Venting of current hot water heater: via chimney or through the wall. All costs are for the unit only, this does not include installation, transportation or additional costs. A tankless water heater typically relies on an in-line filter to prevent sediment and other solids from entering and clogging the heat exchanger.

However, if you have a long term commitment to your current residence, a whole-home tankless gas water heater may be a viable option.</p>
