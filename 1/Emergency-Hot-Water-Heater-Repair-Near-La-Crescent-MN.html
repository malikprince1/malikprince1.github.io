<h2>Water Heater Services La Crescent Minnesota</h2>
<p>One of the most common investments a homeowner finds themselves required to make in a home is a new water heater.

Anthony PHC Kansas City helps you upgrade to an instant water heater. In the colder months, it might not be an issue with your water heater.

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>

Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>

<p>More damage — the extra time spent heating the water will cause more wear on the metal tank and lead to more brittle metal that can crack and develop tiny holes. When the furnace and water heater are in the same room, you only need one gas line to supply the duo.

<p>If your water heater is in a location that will cause damage to your home, you should strongly consider replacing it after 10 years (or before, if any of the following symptoms occur). With a gas heater turn the thermostat knob to the pilot setting. Tankless heaters provide continuous hot water, so gone are the days of the hot water running out mid-shower.

<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>In part that's because removing a large tank takes more time and effort than removing the much smaller tankless units. You'll also notice it's no longer necessary to run the water until it heats up. Although it costs more upfront, in the long run a tankless water heater is a money-saver.
