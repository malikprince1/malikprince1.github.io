Compared to traditional water heaters, tankless water heaters are smaller and can help you make the most out of your property's utility room space. When hot water is turned on at the faucet, a series of high-efficiency heating elements come to life, quickly heating the water as it passes through the system.</p>
<p>Failed heating elements, faulty water heater thermostats, or discolored water all indicate a problem with your water heater. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work. High efficiency water heaters from Navien deliver endless, on-demand hot water at one or more places in your home.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play.

<p>High energy bills - An old water heater may be working harder than it needs to and, in turn, raising your energy bills unnecessarily. Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
