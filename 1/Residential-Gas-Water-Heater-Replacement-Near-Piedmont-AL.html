<h2>Water Heater Services Piedmont Alabama</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>The tankless water heater must be able to deliver this maximum flow rate at the desired temperature rise. With the amount of money you'll save on energy costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and longer-lasting nature of these systems, you'll enjoy safer and more reliable warm water for longer, which keeps more money in your pocket where it belongs. For instance, less natural resources go into the manufacturing of these compact size heaters.</p>
