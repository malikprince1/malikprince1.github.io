<h2>Water Heater Services Bogart Georgia</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room). The tankless heater is much smaller than a traditional tank water heater. Longer useful lives than storage tank water heaters. Many homeowners in Fort Wayne, IN are switching to a tankless water heater.</p>

<p>We'll take a look at some potential water heater malfunctions below. However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>
<p>Electric tank-type heaters utilize electrical-resistance heating elements located within the hot water storage tank to heat up the water within the tank. There is no need for a storage tank nor is there any energy wasted on heat loss with the tankless heating systems. Hot water heaters heat up the water supplied by your friendly utilities company, allowing you to do things like luxuriate in hot, candle-lit bathtubs, wash beautiful bone china, and keep yourself in a steady supply of clean underwear.</p>
<p>When it comes to installation, manufacturers recommend that you have a professional plumbing contractor help you with this process. And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used. Many jurisdictions consider new water heater installation and replacement water heater installation a different type of job (i.e., a permit may be required for one, but not the other). A tankless water heater in a bathroom is a popular option amongst today's homeowners.</p>

Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>They are smaller than conventional storage heaters, are wall mounted and do not take up floor space. Common problems you can expect to experience include low gas pressure, a low heating capacity, or rusty-looking water. Make sure when you call a plumber you call a licensed plumber that is experienced in repairing tankless water heaters. Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater installation codes.</p>
<p>Tightening the heating element mounting bolt - Make sure not to overtighten this, though. Installing a whole-house water softener can mitigate calcium buildup, lengthening the life of your water heater. We offer both conventional and tankless water heater options, rebates and eco-friendly discounts. But, as the concept of heating water on demand become more popular, and because tankless water heaters are more energy efficient, homebuilders began installing them.</p>

We highly recommend having your water heater installed by a professional as it is a difficult and sometimes dangerous process. That's why when it's time to equip your new home, or replace your old water heater it's important to consider cost, efficiency, and longevity of your new water heater.</p>
