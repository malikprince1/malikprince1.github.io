<p>Tankless water heaters supply hot water when you need it without the use of a storage tank. The main differences include that a direct vent heater uses an inducer motor to boost the removal of exhaust gas and can be vented with PVC pipe. Internal corrosions is most likely occurring in your water heater and it's time to consider replacing it with a more efficient, modern model. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>When replacing a storage tank heater, the existing venting is often galvanized sheet metal that can oxidize or rust over a long period of time, if condensation collects inside it. The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>

Some of these issues can be addressed by installing a tankless water heater. For expert water heater repair in the Orange County area, look to your neighbors at Barker and Sons Plumbing & Rooter.</p>
