<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
