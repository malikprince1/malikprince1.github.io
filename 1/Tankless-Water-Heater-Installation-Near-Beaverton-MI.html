<h2>Water Heater Services Beaverton Michigan</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>
