<h2>Water Heater Services Menasha Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Let's face it, unless you have invested in the new state-of-the-art tankless systems, water heaters take up a lot of space. The less water you use, the more efficient your tankless water heater will be. That's why these systems are ideal for vacation homes and families that use less water. Replaced 75 gallon electric water heater with rheem 75 gallon Marathon with a lifetime warranty. Most homeowners don't give much thought to the water heater until it goes out. Age - The serial number on the water heater should also contain the date of manufacture, which will give you the heater's age.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>

We'll get to you quickly, assess your needs, and get your water heater repair in Cherry Hill or Burlington completed ASAP.
