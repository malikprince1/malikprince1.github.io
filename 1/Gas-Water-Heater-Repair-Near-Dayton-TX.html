Some state laws require replacement water heaters to be anchored or braced to resist movement during an earthquake, which can cause gas or water line leaks and electrical wiring damage. If your household consumes a great deal of hot water and needs it from more than one outlet at a time then don't purchase a standard tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters will stop working when a pilot light goes out or if a part malfunctions. That's why the performance of tankless water heaters is measured by how many gallons per minute (GPM) the heater will deliver at a desired Temperature Rise. Larger units can heat water for your entire house. A tankless water heater not only eliminates the need for a bulky storage tank, it's a great way to reduce your household energy costs.</p>

And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs. With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>
