<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>Water heater is making noise - Rumbling, banging, knocking or popping noises coming from your water heater are due to accumulated sediment that settles and hardens at the bottom of your tank as it is continually exposed to heat.

<p>Once you have placed the new water heater in the compartment, installed your hot and cold connections, connected your gas supply line, and connected the pressure relief line, you are ready to fill the tank.
