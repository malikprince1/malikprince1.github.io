<h2>Water Heater Services Acton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If it is that time when you are looking to replace your old hot water heater, then it is time to consider changing out to something different. Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>

The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas.

<p>Touch red probe to the power screw terminal of heating element and black probe to the power screw terminal of thermostat. If these stops don't lead to hot water, it's time to either check the heating element in an electric water heater or the burner unit and gas control valve in a gas-powered heater.

If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>Running a close third in expenses is the cost of extending the hot and cold piping.
