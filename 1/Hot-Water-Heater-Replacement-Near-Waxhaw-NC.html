If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>In spite of all benefits, water heaters go down due to various reasons. But if you need to have hot water supply in your bathroom, then you may need a larger unit for this.

<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed.

If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install. That varies with the location and design of the unit, quality of installation, maintenance schedule and water quality.</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated. Depending on the unit, a gas line may need to be run to the installation point, or you may need an electrician to upgrade a panel or wire the unit into place. Water Leaks: Water leaks at the base of your water heater tank are something that needs to be addressed right away. Instead, each efficient Rinnai tankless water heater is only the size of a small suitcase.</p>
<p>Burner or heating element fails. On a gas water heater, his is the dial on the gas control. You want to lower your water heating bills: You may have heard that tankless water heaters cost more upfront, but the savings they deliver allow for a healthy return on investment, especially when you consider the longer lifespan of tankless units. If you install a tankless gas Rinnai water heater inside your home the unit will vent directly to the outside and use a concentric venting system that just need one penetration for intake and exhaust, which improves safety and uses less space.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
