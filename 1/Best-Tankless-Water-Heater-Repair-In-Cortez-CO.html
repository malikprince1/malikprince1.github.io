<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>

Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
