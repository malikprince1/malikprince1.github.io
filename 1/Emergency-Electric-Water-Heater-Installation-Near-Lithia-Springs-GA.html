<h2>Water Heater Services Lithia Springs Georgia</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>

<p>You also get very low NOx and CO2 emissions that mean the air in your home is cleaner and healthier for your family and this is one of the features that makes Rinnai tankless water heaters eco friendly and SCAQMD approved. Attach a garden hose to the drain valve and drain the water left in the tank. The right water heater can keep your baths and showers comfortable, your dishes clean, and your clothes washed—all at a temperature that works best for the soaps you're using.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>

<p>At Premier Plumbing we help you make the right decision based your needs so you know that the water heater you buy is the right one for your home or business at the lowest cost possible. Water heaters can break and leak for various reasons but some of the main problems are the water pressure is too high, a loose drain valve, wear and tear. Like any appliance, tankless water heaters will need regular maintenance and occasional troubleshooting to keep them running optimally.</p>

If your household's hot water consumption is 41 gallons and below, you can save as much as 34 percent in energy usage.</p>
<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater.

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>T&P Valve usually comes with the new heaters. The tankless water heater is going to end up saving you money if you choose to have one in place in your home or business. However, if there is sufficient pressure and the run length is short enough, it is possible to use a ½-inch line, which is used by most existing storage tank-type water heaters.
