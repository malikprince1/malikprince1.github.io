If your demand is higher, then a whole house” tankless water heater or two or more tankless systems will be able to keep up with the demand of your household. When you choose to retrofit a tankless water heater in place of a storage tank variety, your plumber-installer will take more time, increasing the installed cost, of replacing a storage tank water heater because of the complexity of relocating existing piping.</p>
