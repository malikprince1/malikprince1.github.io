<h2>Water Heater Services Olathe Kansas</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>The size of the water heater must also be taken into account. Tankless: As their name implies, tankless, or on-demand water heaters, don't store water in a tank. No matter what your needs are surrounding tankless water heaters, we'll help you meet them and get the hot water you need. Heating systems harness electric or even solar energy. This means inspecting the water pipes connected to the water heater, cleaning any debris and dust, checking the thermostats and safety valves and flushing the system.</p>
<p>Heat pump water heaters qualify as tank-type water heaters and are powered by electricity. You turn on the shower and feel warm water at first, but then get blasted with several seconds of cold water before the temperature slowly climbs back up. Here's what happened: When the first shower ended, some hot water was remaining in the pipes on the way to the shower. Call your local water heating experts at B&B Heating & Cooling.</p>

<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>
