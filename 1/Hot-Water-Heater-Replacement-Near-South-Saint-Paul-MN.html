<h2>Water Heater Services South Saint Paul Minnesota</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>Rather than installing it in your utility room or basement, they are small enough to be installed in non-traditional spaces such as closets. Imagine this situation: Your hot water heater bursts. Whether you know exactly what type of water heater you want or you have questions about which one is right for you we are standing by. Call us today and we can help you decide which water heater is the best one for your current usage & situation.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
