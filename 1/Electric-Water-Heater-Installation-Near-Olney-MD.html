<h2>Water Heater Services Olney Maryland</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>Gas tankless water heaters have a longer life expectancy than traditional tank water heaters. At Green Hills Plumbing we offer quality tankless water heater installation and service. Numerous people don't consider purchasing a new hot water heater until their old ones break down, yet the newer models could end up saving the home owner money in terms of energy expenditures so purchasing one now might save money for the household.</p>
<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute. Tankless water heaters operate by turning on as a hot water tap or appliance is activated, heating the water through a heat exchanger as it is moved to the faucet, dishwasher, washing machine, or shower head. Be sure to look into tankless water heaters because, with this type, you never run out of hot water.</p>
