<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones.

Water Heater- Install what you are taking out if you have a 40 gallon and want to upgrade to a 50 gallon now is the time to do it. If you do have a 50 gallon I DO NOT recommend switching to anything lower than what you have.</p>

So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>
