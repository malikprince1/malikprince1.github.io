<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>Check out the most common problems to determine if a water heater repair or replacement is right for you. Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters can last up to 20 years but need to be maintained at least once a year. Once the water turns off, so does the tankless unit, saving energy and reducing wear and tear. As your water heater pulls water in, it's common that traces of sediment will deposit onto the bottom of your tank.

<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>Efficiency is the name of the game at Payless Water Heaters, and that efficiency means one thing: less stress for you. If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation. Also, know it's purpose because if it will only be running a kitchen sink, you can get away with a model that uses less energy and save a good deal of money.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>
