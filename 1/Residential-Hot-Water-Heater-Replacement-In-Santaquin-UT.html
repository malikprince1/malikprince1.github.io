<h2>Water Heater Services Santaquin Utah</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose. While tankless water heaters are a great alternative to traditional tank water heaters, there are some things to consider before you purchase and allow Barstow and Sons to install them professionally. As with any other appliance or component of your home, proper maintenance is essential to maximize the lifespan of your water heater.</p>

Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>

<h3>When To Call A Plumber Santaquin UT</h3>
<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>During power outages, tankless units will not produce hot water. From saving money to unlimited hot water, these units are ideal for many homeowners. If you're running out of hot water all the time, the problem might not be your water heater. Water heaters should be professionally serviced at least once a year. Generally less expensive than tankless water heaters.
