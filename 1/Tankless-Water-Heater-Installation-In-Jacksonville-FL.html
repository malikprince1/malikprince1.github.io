<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods. This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>The word average” is important: it's possible that your current water heater is still going at age 20, or might quit at age 8. A lot of that is contextual, and could depend on usage, maintenance, and, yes, a bit of luck. This is when flushing the tank is necessary for a quick water heater repair. New installs require retrofit - Replacing your traditional water heater with a tankless hot water heater can be complicated and involve increased installation costs.</p>
<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is outdated. One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
