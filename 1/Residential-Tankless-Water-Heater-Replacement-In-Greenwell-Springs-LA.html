<p>If you are insulating your pipes for your water heater, do not cover dielectric unions, fittings, or copper flex lines. Tankless water heaters produce water faster than a traditional heater. The anode rod in your water heater is designed to attract corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from corroding.

<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>With a conventional tank heater , households with moderate to high rates of consumption will find that they can run out of hot water if they need to use a lot of hot water quickly.

The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
