<h2>Water Heater Services East China Michigan</h2>
<p>More and more people are choosing an electric tankless hot water heater over its gas and propane counterparts. No matter your brand of water heater, or if it's gas or electric, our skilled team can handle your repair effectively and affordably. Whether it be in your commercial business or your home, water heaters are vital across the board. Tankless water heaters are a compact, efficient way to supply hot water to your home. Sediment build-up can also cause your water heating element to short circuit, leading to complete failure.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well you maintain and care for your water heater, the average life span of most water heaters is from 8 to 12 years. If you live in the following neighborhoods of Agoura Hill, Downtown, Forest Cove, South end, Malibu Junction, East Agoura, and Old Agoura, then you need to find plumbing services to help you repair your heater. For nearly 30 years, we've been the trusted name in plumbing, heating, and air conditioning, offering an unmatched level of service at reasonable rates.</p>

Are installed mostly in homes built after 1995, homes with no chimney or homes that have converted from another water heating source making them one of the more commonly used water heaters in Ontario. As plumbing experts, we've seen these hot water issues in dozens of properties and they're usually caused by a pilot light that's not lit, a burner issue, a gas leak, a thermostat issue, or a mechanical issue.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation East China</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>We have extensive experience with tankless water heater services - from installation to replacement and everything in between - and our trained staff is dedicated to doing the job right the first time, every time. A home that has a water heater that's too small for its needs will constantly be out of hot water, and a water heater that's too big for the household is a waste of money. A tankless water heater system allows you to have the hot water you want on demand without any hassles.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

Visual deterioration - If your water heater tank is showing visual signs of a problem, then you should consider replacing it.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>

Copy the nameplate data of the water heater to purchase correct replacement parts. As water heaters generally hold 50 gallons of water, a breakdown can result in a damaging flood. If repair is not an option, we will help you determine the best replacement. One set of coils is the water line, the other, the heating element.</p>
<p>These heaters are useful in residences as well as commercial establishments, and can be used in single and multiple unit set ups. A good quality water heater not only reduces the repair and maintenance charges but also acts as an energy saver. Gravity fed water heaters meet the water flow rate requirements and do not require a water efficient shower head or flow restrictor to be installed. It is important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a dangerous time bomb.</p>
