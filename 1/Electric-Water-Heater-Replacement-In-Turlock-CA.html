Unlike conventional water heaters, there is no backup hot water source during these emergency situations.

They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds.

This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
