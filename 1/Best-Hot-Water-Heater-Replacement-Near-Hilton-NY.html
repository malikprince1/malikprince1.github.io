<h2>Water Heater Services Hilton New York</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>

Generally your first call for a balky water heater will be to a plumber, but if the plumber finds an electrical issue, you may need to call in a licensed electrician. Maintenance is the best way to make sure your water heater is in good condition, water heater maintenance isn't always something we think about doing.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>The T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) is a safety device that creates a pathway for the water to escape if the pressure inside the tank builds to a dangerous level for any reason.

Has water heater specialists skilled in both tank and tankless water heater installations. Just makes sure you avoid these three hot water system installation pitfalls.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Our plumbers take the time to do installs right, leading to more energy-efficient hot water for you and your family.

Water Heaters Only Inc has been specializing in water heater replacement since 1968. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings.</p>

Not only do we offer water heater repair for your home or business, but we also install water heaters, as well.</p>
