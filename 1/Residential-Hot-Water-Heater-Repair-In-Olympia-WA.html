<h2>Water Heater Services Olympia Washington</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>Clean the pipes beforehand with steel wool if you want to reduce the amount of buildup in the water heater, but it is not required as there is only a little bit of deposit that could get into the heater from copper tubing.

<p>Tankless water heaters are compact heating units that provide hot water as it is needed and do not store hot water like traditional tank-type water heaters.
