Also, they cannot be located outside your home like tankless water heaters. Thermocouple Problems: This safety device is an essential part of your gas water heater. The installation cost is usually cheapest if you install it near the old hookups. Before starting work, ask your installer to outline all costs.</p>

<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Installation Alexandria</h3>

Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater.

However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
