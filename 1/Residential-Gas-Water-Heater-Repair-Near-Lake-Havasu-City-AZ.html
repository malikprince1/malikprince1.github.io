<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Lake Havasu City AZ</h3>
<p>Our technicians carry many commonly utilized water heater parts on our trucks, which allows us to make repair promptly. The standard water heater only lasts eight to 12 years. Tankless water heaters, as their name suggests, heat water on-demand and do not maintain a supply of water. There are a variety of advantages to switching over to a tankless water heater. As the name implies, tankless water heaters eliminate the need for a bulky hot water tank by connecting directly to your plumbing system.</p>

They came right on time, discussed the options and proceeded to repair our water heater for far less than a new one.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Lake Havasu City Arizona 86406</h3>
<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>The gas tankless water heater installation cost would be in the $1200 to $3000 range if switching from electric to gas. The tankless unit also uses a PVC flue pipe, which can be installed when a standard chimney is either not available or not practical. Water heaters are not products that are meant to last for a lifetime, thus, there are times in which your water heater will need to be repaired. At PV, we perform high quality, professionally audited installations of natural gas tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>
<p>This can save you a great deal of valuable storage room compared to other models of water heaters that are available. Installing tankless water heater will hardly take our plumbers much time. People with electric hot water heaters will see a greater cost reduction than those with natural gas heaters, but everyone will save money over time. They provide hot water to any source of a home or business on demand rather than having to wait for the water in the tank to heat up.</p>
<p>If your water heater is malfunctioning, give Assured Comfort a call. Providing nearly twice the service life and exceptional efficiency, tankless water heating adds value to the home. You need to be extra careful when you are handling gas, even though it is safe once it is installed, it has the ability to cause quite an amount of damage if not handled in a proper manner. In many cases a professional plumber can have a water heater repaired in 2 to 3 hours, but this can vary depending on the problem.</p>
