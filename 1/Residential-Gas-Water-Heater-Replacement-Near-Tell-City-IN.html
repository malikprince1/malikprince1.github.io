<h3>Water Tank Repair Tell City Indiana 47586</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>In addition to the upfront cost, which carries significant weight in the decision for many, other factors also include the number of people in the house, any remodeling in the home, as well as the expense to operate the heater.

With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit.
