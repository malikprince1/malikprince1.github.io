<p>At PV, we follow all best practices for installing your water heater - not just code requirements, but every smart precaution and protocol. Looking at the pros and cons for each, a storage tank water heater, and a tankless water heater, you would also need to consider the requirements of your needs and then decide what best suits you. If maintenance is put off and your water heater doesn't get the care it needs, it will eventually lead to repairs.</p>
<p>If you have an older water heater, there are many reasons for you to consider upgrading to a new one, including better energy efficiency, better performance, and less risk of a breakdown.

Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>If the tank is cold or very hot, it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat. Next, the water heater must be connected to a fuel source. Before removing your old water heater, we'll assess your property's specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective option.
