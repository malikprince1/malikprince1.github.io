<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater doesn't use a storage tank to heat water. The most popular style of new water heaters on the market is the tankless water heater.

By combining these costs over a pre-determined period of time, we are able to understand and compare the total cost of ownership. If the TP valve or outlet pipe is cold, the water heater hasn't been working for several hours. Prices range from about $170 for small gas-fired units to more than $2,000 for high-output heaters that can supply two showers at the same time; $1,000 is about average.</p>

For more than 30 years now, we've taken pride in satisfying customers with quality replacement services.

The Insurance Information Institute reports that water damage and freezing claims occur about 1.5 times for each 100 homeowner's policies per year, with an average severity of over $5000.</p>
<p>Additional materials: some of the tankless systems will also be incompatible with the location and setup of older storage tank models. Many, like Navien tankless water heaters, qualify for energy efficiency rebates and credits from local utility companies because they are certified Energy Star products.

Whether you're just moving into your first home or you've been in the same place for years, it's important to have your hot water heater inspected and maintained.</p>
<p>Place the water heater in a drip pan made for this purpose if the equipment is located inside the home, and especially if it is in the attic. Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>
<p>If your instant hot water heater is struggling to maintain or reach your set temperature, an inspection is warranted. Furthermore, the installation must comply with all national, state and local electrical and plumbing codes. One of the best ways to save on plumbing maintenance is to invest in a maintenance service agreement Whether you need HVAC or plumbing services, all plans include 7-day, 24-hour emergency service.</p>
<p>Also known as instant heaters, they do not produce the standby energy losses you are likely to find with traditional heaters, thereby saving you money. To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
