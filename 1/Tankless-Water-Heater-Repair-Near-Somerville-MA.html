<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Repair Somerville</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>The only bigger percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless water heaters are heaters which work dynamically, heating water up as you request it, so no energy gets wasted storing any heated water, there's no bulk since the tankless water heater is just a small box, and you'll have no difficulties concealing it under a sink or behind a piece of furniture for example. We want you to know exactly what we're doing as we do it, both so you can be informed during the installation process and so you can properly maintain and understand your unit after it's installed.</p>
<p>For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand water heaters can be 24%-34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters. As people and companies all across the country take additional preparations to protect against the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we acknowledge that your Plumbing, Heating or Cooling problems will likely not be taking a break. A standard water heater is comprised of a large tank that holds around 60 to 100 gallons of water.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Somerville Massachusetts 02145</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>If this is impossible and only a single unit can be installed, you will discover that it can not give hot water for multiple units. Usually, when a hot water heater gives out, owners are forced to make a split-second decision to make sure that residents get their hot water back ASAP. Our expert team of plumbers, electricians, heating repair technicians, AC repair technicians, and system design managers performs top-quality repairs and installations while ensuring you are completely satisfied with your entire customer service.</p>
<p>If you have an older water heater, there are many reasons for you to consider upgrading to a new one, including better energy efficiency, better performance, and less risk of a breakdown. Add $100 to $225 for gas hot water replacement cost. For a traditional tankless gas water heater installation with Quality Comfort, you can expect a range of $2,500-$3,200. Most solar heating systems have a separate hot water tank designed to capture all the heat generated from the system.</p>
<p>You should flush your water heater once per year to help remove sediment or rust that may be building up. This will greatly increase the life of your water heater and can even extend it beyond the manufacturer's warranty timeframe. Many of our customers see the benefit of installing tankless water heaters because they're compact, efficient and reported to save nearly 40% on energy costs ( DOE ). And the harder your heater has to work, the more it will be exposed to high temperatures and make the tank brittle.</p>
<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
