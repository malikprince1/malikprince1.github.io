Tanks with larger capacity or energy-efficiency upgrades cost more.</p>

<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions.

Tankless water heaters only heat water on an as-needed basis and will never run out of hot water during normal operation. It may be time to consider a tankless system.
