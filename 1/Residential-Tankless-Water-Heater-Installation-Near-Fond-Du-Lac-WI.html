If these tanks are replaced with tankless hot water heaters, newfound space can be converted into another resident amenity, such as on-site storage or laundry, both of which can bring in extra revenue. Most heaters are not sold with these jackets in place so a lot of heat can be lost through the tanks body.</p>

You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>

Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
