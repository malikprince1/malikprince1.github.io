<h2>Water Heater Services Avenal California</h2>
<p>Below are some good reasons why you should consider a tankless hot water heater for your new or pre-existing home, office, workshop, or cabin project. There are other advantages to having a tankless water heater and that you will not have to worry about your young ones going down and playing with the facet that is on the outside of the water heater and taking a chance on getting burnt in the end with it. Plus you are not going to need to make sure that there is not unused hot water in your tankless water heater that would end up running the pipes in the long run.</p>
<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>The more people and the more simultaneous usage possibilities, the greater the GPM needs to be. One solution is to install multiple tankless units to meet the demands of a large household, but that can become very expensive. A typical tankless water heater can produce between 7 and 15 litres of hot water per minute. However, if you have a long term commitment to your current residence, a whole-home tankless gas water heater may be a viable option.</p>

New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once.

<p>Like all other plumbing systems in your home, regular maintenance can ensure your home's hot water heater continues to perform at its very best.

<p>Who should buy a tank water heater: If you have a timeline or budget constraints that prevent you from getting a tankless system, a tank heater may be the way to go. If your home runs strictly on electricity, you have to carefully consider whether going tankless is really worth it. The average household capacity is around 200 amps, which may not be enough to support a tankless electric heater. Tankless hot water heaters are available in propane (LP), natural gas, or electric models.</p>
