<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water.
