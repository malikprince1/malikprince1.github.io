Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water.

Electric tankless water heaters provide continuous hot water when sized appropriately, producing and maintaining hot water throughout your home or business as needed.
