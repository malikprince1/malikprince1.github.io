<h2>Water Heater Services Thomaston Georgia</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Here at Althoff, we have professional plumbers that can install any size water heater for residential and commercial buildings, and they have the knowledge, experience and skill to pull the required permits and properly install the water heater.

Today's plumbing code requires all tank-style water heaters to have a temperature and pressure relief valve that opens to release pressure and eliminate the possibility of the tank exploding. Traditional water heaters are easier and less costly to install, but they do cost more to run.</p>

<p>There is no way around it. And this is technology used in these tankless heaters is modern and hi-tech, but they produce one disadvantage that while CO2 emissions are reduced, an acidic condensate is formed. Excessive buildup of sediment in the bottom of the tank can cause the bottom of the tank to overheat, boiling the water. If your showers have recently started to be ruined by unexpected blasts of cold water, then it's time to call in an expert from The Plumbing & Air Service Co. for quick solutions and trusted water heater installation and repair services you can count on.</p>
<p>If you're starting to see the signs below, it's time to think about replacing your water heater.

Some state laws require replacement water heaters to be anchored or braced to resist movement during an earthquake, which can cause gas or water line leaks and electrical wiring damage. If your household consumes a great deal of hot water and needs it from more than one outlet at a time then don't purchase a standard tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>On more recent water heaters, the combustion chamber may be sealed. This matters since it would require more power to heat colder water. There can be huge variances in what different gas fitters charge for hot water system installation cost. If this happens, you should reduce the demand for hot water by limiting simultaneous applications, and you may want to consider resetting your unit. Traditional tank water heaters take up valuable space in a basement, attic or closet—space you could use.</p>
<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Thomaston GA</h3>
<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
