<h2>Water Heater Services Unionville Connecticut</h2>

With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks.

Tankless Water Heaters are much different from the traditional water heaters we have today. For example, electrical units don't need ventilation, so there's no need to install a ventilation line alongside a water line like you would with a gas unit.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to check the anode when you flush the heater, if you make this a routine you will be able to replace the anode before it is completely gone. Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>

<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water. Tankless units supply a steady stream of hot water with no waiting and no running short. This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill.

The number of model choices can be overwhelming, but Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating takes the time to understand your needs and ensures that the water heater you select meets current city, state and national rules.
