<h2>Water Heater Services Oak Brook Illinois</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Tank water heaters are the most common kind of water heater. After that, the new water heater can be brought in and maneuvered into place. When setting up a space heating water heating system you need a higher output quick recovery unit for some systems, like an electric forced hot air handler serviced by a hydronic heating coil. In the end, it is putting more pressure on the water heater to work. Our maintenance free heating units help water temperatures stay at safe levels.</p>
