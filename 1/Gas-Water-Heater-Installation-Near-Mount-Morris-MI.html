Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life.

Rumbling, popping or banging noise from inside the water heater. Codes require a subpanel (which may be supplied along with the unit) to be installed next to the unit. The electric heaters on the other hand can last from ten to fifteen years.</p>

The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
