<h2>Water Heater Services Sullivan Indiana</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Sullivan</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>Although still an efficient enough way to heat water, some of the problems cited with these storage tank water heaters include the heated water limits, the heating delays and maintenance problems.

<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient. Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>

When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>This also means that apart from calling the best plumbers like Vortex Plumbing Inc to help you out, you should inspect your heater from time to time. A water heater will typically last for between 10 and 20 years. If you have been using your heaters for this long, then it is probably more cost efficient to replace them than to just repair them.

<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>

We have seen our fair share of bad thermostats, heating elements, and check valves. You can change a thermocouple on most water heaters with only a small adjustable wrench.</p>
<p>Next, your installer will mount the actual heating unit. For most households, the ideal hot water temperature is between 120 and 140 degrees. Instead of fighting over who gets the first shower in the morning, you don't have to worry about that with a new water heater. When you turn the hot water tap off the heat exchanger shuts down, saving energy and money. B&B Heating & Cooling are Homer Glen's tankless water heater specialists.</p>
