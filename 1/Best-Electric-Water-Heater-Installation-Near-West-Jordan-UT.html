That said, the tankless system may qualify for state or federal tax rebates for energy-efficient appliances.</p>
<p>If the valve didn't work, then the water heater needs to be replaced. Step 3. Turn off the water to the water heater or if the valve is not working turn off the water to the house. Electric tankless water heaters provide continuous hot water when sized appropriately, producing and maintaining hot water throughout your home or business as needed.

<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time. The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>

<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>You may have a short in the heating element or a thermostat problem. Tankless water heaters are typically more expensive than conventional models, with prices ranging from $600 to $2,000, plus installation; in comparison, a standard water heater runs between $300 and $1,000.
