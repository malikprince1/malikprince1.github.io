<h2>Water Heater Services Granite Falls Washington</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Replacement Granite Falls</h3>
<p>When your water heater fails, a brand new water heater may be called for, especially if your existing unit is very old. Call Epic Plumbing at (281) 815-2322 to schedule an appointment for professional tankless water heater repair and installation services in Pearland. Yes, some problems with water heaters can be repaired but not all. This cuts down on the water heater's efficiency and its ability to adequately heat the water.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>
<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient. Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>
<p>Most people make a healthy investment when buying and installing an new water heater for their home or business. If there's a problem with your water heater, all you have to do is pick up the phone and give us a call. Using the purchase price, annual energy cost, and an estimated cost of installation, we calculated the payback time for both new and replacement installations. A tankless water heater is designed to heat water so incredibly fast that you don't need a storage tank.</p>

<p>Since there is no tank to fill and refill, tankless water heaters give you an endless supply of hot water, so it doesn't matter how many people are using it at any given time.

Once the gas and water are off, and the water heater is drained, you can rest easy that the you will not have to deal with untold amounts of damage and concentrate on repairing or replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>The Powerstar AE125 electric tankless water heater has a life expectancy of about 20 years. The upper one controls both heating elements while the lower one only controls one heating element.

<p>A water heater is an item that most homeowners don't think about daily. We'll answer all your questions and provide the information you need to decide if a tankless heater fits your needs. The major difference between the two types is that the flow controlled type works only with cold water while the thermostatic type can function with hot or cold water. Tankless water heaters heat water directly without the use of a storage tank.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>A lot goes into installation, including safety, plumbing permits from the county, and gas, electrical, or other connections. For starters, with an electric hot water heater you you can kill the gas line coming into the house, if you already have one or completely eliminate the need to put one in, if you do. This will leave you with one less bill to worry about. As these heating systems are tankless, your risk of flooding is diminished.</p>
<p>Using a tankless water heater can reduce these costs by up to 50 percent, for an average annual savings of $80. Quite a few water heater manufacturers advise that you flush your water heater at least once a year to decrease the accumulation of minerals. Connect a hose to the water heater's drain valve. In this article, I provide a comprehensive list of the pros and cons of tankless water heaters so you can make a well-informed decision based on your unique situation.</p>
<p>You should flush your water heater once per year to help remove sediment or rust that may be building up. This will greatly increase the life of your water heater and can even extend it beyond the manufacturer's warranty timeframe. Many of our customers see the benefit of installing tankless water heaters because they're compact, efficient and reported to save nearly 40% on energy costs ( DOE ). And the harder your heater has to work, the more it will be exposed to high temperatures and make the tank brittle.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a tankless water heater system is that they eliminate the extra cost of keeping 40 to 50 gallons of water hot in a storage tank, so you waste less energy. Tankless water heaters only heat water on an as-needed basis and will never run out of hot water during normal operation. It may be time to consider a tankless system. When the gas fumes from a gas water heater travel up and out the draft diverter on top of the gas water heater, they go to the outside of your house through a vent.</p>
