Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>

<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods. This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>
