<h2>Water Heater Services Richlands North Carolina</h2>
<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>
<p>The Energy Factor (EF) rating on the label will tell you have efficient the hot water heater is at transferring heat from the energy source to the water. If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation. Consumer Reports recently tested several electric and gas whole-house tankless water heaters from brands such as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>
<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Installation Richlands</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>We recommend upgrading your water heater now which will save on the heater breaking down at an inconvenient time. If you are eyeing a tankless water heater replacement, here is how the system works.

<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Richlands NC</h3>
<p>Whole house units are more costly, but will heat all the water in your home at once. With an energy factor of 0.80, such water heaters don't use any energy when they are idle,. You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water. Although tankless water heaters are also called "instantaneous water heaters," they still take time to heat water, so after the trapped water was used up, you were left with a gap of unheated water.</p>
<p>If your local water's hardness exceeds 8 grains per gallon, you may need to install a water filter prior to installing the water heater.

<p>Water Heaters Only, Inc provides water heater service in San Jose and the surrounding and the surrounding communities including: Santa Clara, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Morgan Hill and Monte Serreno. Tankless water heaters can be powered by both gas and electricity. If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas shutoff valve in the supply line, too, before disconnecting it. If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
