Smith lightweight and easy-to-install electric tankless water heaters can be mounted in small or tight spaces throughout your home. Worse yet… you arrive home after a nice evening out only to find your home or garage is flooded because from your water heater leaking. For the purpose of cost and efficiency, it's important to have an appropriately sized hot water storage tank.

<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas.
