Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
<p>Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed. Depending on the position of your water hookups, you may not be able to use the oversized water heater at all. Traditional water heaters come with up to a six-year warranty. These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the unit, where incoming cold water can absorb most of the heat.</p>
