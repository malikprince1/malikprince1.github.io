<h2>Water Heater Services Bristol Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>

Although tankless water heaters heat water on demand, they do have output limits on their flow rate. Gas water heater system installation (hot water heater system replacement) requires a plumber who is also a licensed gas fitter for the hot water system installation. Tankless water heaters are a higher initial cost, but they will cost less to operate because they only need to heat water as it is required and use less energy.</p>

Not only will it help you lower your energy costs, but also it can help you save space in your home. No matter what problems you're experiencing, dealing with an aging or damaged water heater is undoubtedly frustrating and disruptive.</p>

Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>
<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>The most efficient storage tank has an energy factor of about67, but according to Energy Star, some tankless units have energy factors as high as95.
