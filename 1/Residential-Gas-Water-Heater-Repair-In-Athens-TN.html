<h2>Water Heater Services Athens Tennessee</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>You need to independently look at hot water heater system replacement types and hot water system prices, comparing the pros and cons of the various hot water system installation alternatives, to make an informed decision. A tankless water heater simply does less work, and that means it doesn't wear down as fast. The leaking in the pressure valve will mean that you need to repair or replace it when repair is no longer possible.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Athens</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Failed heating elements, faulty water heater thermostats, or discolored water all indicate a problem with your water heater. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work. High efficiency water heaters from Navien deliver endless, on-demand hot water at one or more places in your home.</p>
<p>We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters provided in several sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation. Tankless Water Heaters do not require much room for installation and can be fixed at any place that supports direct water supply to the device and have enough space for venting. Call us now at 770-285-5709 to schedule water heater repair in Lilburn, GA and surrounding areas. You will get professional and personalized advice about which unit best reflects your situation and your pocketbook: Water heater options are myriad, and local, licensed plumbing companies such as ours are familiar with all of them.</p>
<p>If your water heater is old and breaks down, you may be better off replacing it, as the average repair costs more than half the average cost of replacement. Assured Comfort repairs and services all brands of residential and commercial hot water heaters. Gas water heater: Confirm that the gas supply is shut off at the shutoff valves, then disconnect the gas line to the water heater. If you're old water heater pipe is damaged or not compatible with the new system, you will have to purchase new piping ($8-$10 per linear foot).</p>

<p>If so, a tankless water heater may be a good option for your home and your family. A tankless system on the other hand doesn't store water, but rather heats it only when you need it. It does this through a design of super-heated coils. If your water heater is leaking or isn't heating your water well enough, call today. Draining the water heater is easy but be sure to get it started first since it will take a while to drain off and no one wants to carry water heater up a flight of stairs while there's still water in it.

<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can now compare prices online for all the major brands of gas hot water systems prices including Rinnai hot water system price, Bosch hot water, Rheem hot water systems prices, Dux hot water system prices and AquaMAX hot water. According to the website, tankless heaters can provide between 2-5 gallons per minute, with gas-powered units producing the higher GPM. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
