<h2>Water Heater Services Okemos Michigan</h2>
<p>With all of the different problems that can result from having a hot water heater, it's always good to know what the most common ones are and how to handle them. If your demand is higher, then a whole house” tankless water heater or two or more tankless systems will be able to keep up with the demand of your household. When you choose to retrofit a tankless water heater in place of a storage tank variety, your plumber-installer will take more time, increasing the installed cost, of replacing a storage tank water heater because of the complexity of relocating existing piping.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>
<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas. We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>

If the backflow which runs between the main water supply and the house is blocked, you have a closed plumbing system, and closed systems require an expansion to handle the pressure created when the water expands once it is heated.</p>
<p>The following guide explains how to install an electric tankless water heater step by step. These units heat faster and are more economical than standard electric models. Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Okemos Michigan 48864</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>After many decades of service, we have found Bradford-White and Navien water heaters are the best in the industry. Consult with your local Roto-Rooter plumber to establish a water heater maintenance schedule that will maximize the life of your appliance. The T&P valve is located on the top or the side of the water heater. For instance, if the breaker and wire size is too small to carry the electrical load of the new water heater, then a permit may be required to make the changes.</p>
<p>Riley - There is a bit more to installing a tankless than a standard heater. If sediment or rust has built up in your water tank, it could be smothering or insulating the element. Plus SMUD offers 1,000-$3,000 in rebates on these units making them the perfect choice for a new water heater replacement.

In fact, they will cost a lot up front, and will then be hard to install the first time. The idea of installing a Tankless Water Heater has a ton of appeal to homeowners. Here are a few of our most frequently asked questions about gas water heaters and electric water heater systems.</p>
<p>If you're continually running out of hot water mid-shower, then chances are your unit is not properly sized for the needs of your home.
