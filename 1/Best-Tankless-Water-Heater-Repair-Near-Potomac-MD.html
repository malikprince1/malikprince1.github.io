<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away.

<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model.

And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>
