<h2>Water Heater Services Manasquan New Jersey</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units. Call (805) 499-0448 today to begin your expert AC repair, installation, or replacement. Tank style water heaters generally last about ten years. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down.</p>
