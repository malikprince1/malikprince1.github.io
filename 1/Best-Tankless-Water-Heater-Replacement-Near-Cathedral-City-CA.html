<h2>Water Heater Services Cathedral City California</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>During the course of an average home occupancy, a resident is bound to face that moment where they need to replace a water heater. Traditional tank water heaters can become rusted or corroded over time. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently prepared. Importantly, all types of tankless water heaters use at least some electricity to operate the control systems. Run clean water through the heater for a few minutes, using the same pump arrangement as before.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Cathedral City</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>Gas water heaters are a little different from other types of water heaters, so it is important that the technician working on the heater has the right tools and experience. Water pooling around or under your water heater is a sign of either corrosion or a damaged part. Tankless water heaters are a cost effective option for residential or commercial water heaters. Everyday tank water heaters retain large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at a time.</p>

The units provide as much as 7 gallons of hot water per minute and will never run out of hot water. Cycling losses - the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank, or inlet and outlet pipes.</p>
<p>Turn on the circuit breaker and run the hot water heater to verify that it is heating the water effectively. Mount the tankless water heater securely to the platform. On the other hand, if you have a non-leaking water heater and no hot water, you can often correct that yourself without calling a plumber.

<p>Every year flush the water in your water heater - this simple procedure clears the tank of sediment build-up, prolonging the service of both the tank and the heating element. They do this by running the water across a series of heating elements and then directly to your faucet. The T&P deposit pipe should not be connected to a drain; if the valve opens and the water goes down a drain, you might miss early warning signs of a problem in your water heater that could worsen if not addressed.</p>
<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>Natural-gas water heaters typically use less energy and cost less to run (by about half) than electric water heaters, although you should note that gas models cost more at the time of purchase. We also provide emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When properly maintained, tankless water heaters often have a lifespan of at least 20 years (approximately twice that of conventional storage tanks).</p>
