<h2>Water Heater Services Marysville California</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well you maintain and care for your water heater, the average life span of most water heaters is from 8 to 12 years.

Unlike other water heaters, this type of water heater does not lose energy while in standby mode, allowing you to save more money over the long-term. Ferran Services is here to answer any question you might have, determine the perfect fit for your household, and provide proper installation.</p>

A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>
