Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>You need to independently look at hot water heater system replacement types and hot water system prices, comparing the pros and cons of the various hot water system installation alternatives, to make an informed decision. A tankless water heater simply does less work, and that means it doesn't wear down as fast.
