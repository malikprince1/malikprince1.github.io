<h2>Water Heater Services Spotsylvania Virginia</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>
