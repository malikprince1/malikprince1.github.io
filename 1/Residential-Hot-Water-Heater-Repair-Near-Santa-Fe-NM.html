<h2>Water Heater Services Santa Fe New Mexico</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
