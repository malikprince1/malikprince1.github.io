I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000. Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future. Mallick Plumbing & Heating is the Service Contractor of Choice in Silver Spring, MD and throughout Montgomery County. Storage tank water heaters have lower initial cost by a significant margin.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.
