<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>This soon eats up a lot of energy and eventually raises your electric and gas bills. Poorly installed electric wires can suddenly overheat and burn down your home. There is most likely a malfunction in your water heater and a replacement should be considered. There's no reason not to. You may think that because you live in an area that is generally colder and overcast much of the time that you cant use a solar hot water heater.</p>

Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated. Depending on the unit, a gas line may need to be run to the installation point, or you may need an electrician to upgrade a panel or wire the unit into place. Water Leaks: Water leaks at the base of your water heater tank are something that needs to be addressed right away. Instead, each efficient Rinnai tankless water heater is only the size of a small suitcase.</p>

The gas hot water replacement cost would be between $1000 and $2500, in a different location. The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>There are several large companies that produce hot water heaters. Plus, they save space, eliminate the risk of water damage due to a leaking water storage tank, and last up to twice as long as a conventional water heater.

<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
