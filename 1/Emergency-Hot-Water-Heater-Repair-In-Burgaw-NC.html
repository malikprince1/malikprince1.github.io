<h2>Water Heater Services Burgaw North Carolina</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>If you want your water heater to be replaced with a Mike Diamond Plumbing water heater we are happy to still keep your planned appointment. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you think that your hot water heater is failing, or you just purchased a home and aren't sure about the condition of your heater, it's important to work with a water heater inspection company to evaluate your system.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Burgaw</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>Prices vary depending on the option purchased, but the average price on these heaters is about $500. While you look for a unit, consider the following things: fuel types (gas or electric, unit type (tank or tankless), the length and coverage or warranty, how many people live in your home, long-term maintenance requirements, and operating costs. Our hot water installation services are second to none because we only employ technicians who have been certified to handle the job.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>We provide FREE in-home Energy Consultations to evaluate your current system and help you choose the best water heater for your home. Hooking your tankless heater up to a solar system yields the best energy savings and reduces water heating expenses by 50%-80%. The Rinnai line of tankless hot water heaters feature indoor and outdoor models. But if you don't have a gas line into the house and have to use an electric unit, existing wiring may have to be upgraded.</p>
