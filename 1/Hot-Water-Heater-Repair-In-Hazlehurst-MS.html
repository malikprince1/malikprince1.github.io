Radiant heating is a type of heating setup where the heat is supplied by electric wiring or hot water tubes installed into or under the flooring, and sometimes walls and ceilings. The steps for replacing a propane water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. They use electricity to pump heat from the air or the ground to your water tank, using less energy than traditional water heaters.</p>
