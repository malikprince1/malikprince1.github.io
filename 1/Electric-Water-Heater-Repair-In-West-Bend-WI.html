<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair West Bend</h3>
<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>

Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design.

<p>A booster is a highly useful device that can help your small heater act like a larger one, and it can even save you energy and space in your home.

A lot of that is contextual, and could depend on usage, maintenance, and, yes, a bit of luck. This is when flushing the tank is necessary for a quick water heater repair.
