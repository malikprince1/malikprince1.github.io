<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed.

<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Graniteville</h3>
<p>In an electric tankless water heater, an electric element heats the water. This type of system uses the same type of panels and liquid system, but instead to transfer solar energy for only the hot water tank, heated fluid flows through a system that can heat up the entire house. Since you are dealing with gas, you will want to ensure that you are using a qualified plumber for this replacement.

The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>Turn Off On Its Own: If there issues within the tankless water heater than it can cause it to turn off on its own. Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone. In most cases, the water heater always gives way to the furnace thereby depriving you of hot water supply. A cracked or corroded storage tank is also a sign you need to replace your entire unit.</p>

<p>If there is a similar problem with an electric tank-type water heater, no such explosion can occur. What it does is provide hot water on demand so you don't have to worry about the shower suddenly running cold. This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank.
