<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>

Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
