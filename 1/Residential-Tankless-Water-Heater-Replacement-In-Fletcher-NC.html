<h2>Water Heater Services Fletcher North Carolina</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>The cold water will enter the tank, then the water will be heated and then the hot water will be stored until there will be demands coming from the bathroom shower or tap, or the dishwasher or kitchen sink. Solar water heaters: These water heaters use the power of the sun to heat water. Just call us and ask us, Please fix my water heater problems!” and we'll be there soon to get your hot water running normally again.</p>

The average GPM capacity of most residential tankless water heaters is between 2-5 gallons per minute, with many gas-powered units producing a higher flow than electric units. Electric hot water tanks in the basement.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>In addition to customer service information, our free monthly e-newsletter is full of tips to help you save energy and money, as well as keep you safe and comfortable. Within the heat exchanger, there is an electric resistance coil that warms the water to the desired temperature as it travels through.

<h3>How To Overcome Emergency Plumbing Issues Fletcher NC</h3>
<p>Please follow all plumbing and electrical codes when sourcing and installing parts for your new water heater. Whether you're running out of hot water on a daily basis, struggling with high energy costs, or worried about deterioration, you may be looking for a change. The actual zone in which the water heater is installed doesn't matter. Tankless water heaters are also supposed to be drained and the filters cleaned every month.</p>
<p>In addition to providing expert tankless water heater repairs, we also specialize in installations and replacements. Other materials, including heat pumps and pipes, are not included in standard installation costs. In locations where water has a high mineral content, otherwise known as hard water, add a water softener to reduce the unwanted effects that those mineral deposits can have on the water heater tank.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>
