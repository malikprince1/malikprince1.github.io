<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work. While the water is draining out of the old heater, Unbox the new water heater.

<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection.
