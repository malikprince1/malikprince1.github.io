<p>Hot water heater problems can occur any time. It is important to know what you are looking for and what your capabilities are when attempting to deal with any hot water heater repair.

Our expert team of licensed plumbers will be able to diagnose the issue with your water heater and determine if it can be fixed with a repair or it needs a replacement.</p>

Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>

We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
