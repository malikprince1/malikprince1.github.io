<h2>Water Heater Services Lawrenceville Virginia</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Lawrenceville</h3>
<p>The two most important areas you have to focus on when installing a tankless water heater are making sure you have the right size fittings and that you have a proper ventilation system set up for the unit. If you live in an area such as Dallas, with hard water, then be sure to call an experienced licensed Dallas plumber to thoroughly check your water heater on a regular basis. A basic solar water heater system can cost $1,000-$4,000 to install, minus possible tax credits of up to 30% off the cost.</p>
<p>While scale can shorten the life of the heating element, you don't need to invest in fancy features to get a water heater that lasts. Tankless heaters can be installed underneath sinks or in small closets as well as in traditional hot water tank enclosures. As a result, their expected equipment life is possibly longer - more than 20 years, compared with 10 - 15 years for traditional heaters. We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, your hot water heater can explode and cause significant damages. Your traditional tank heater provides you with hot water after having to heat the entire tank's capacity - between 30 and 50 gallons. Our experienced plumbing specialists can perform any water heater repair that comes our way in Ocala. They continuously heat water so hot water is consistently prepared. Note: All plumbing installations must conform to the local plumbing code, so consult the local building department for requirements in your area.</p>
<p>When you lose power, there is a reserve of hot water for a short time period. You have no hot water: If you don't have hot water in your home, your water heater clearly isn't working. If your water heater leaks around the base, is over 10 years old, works erratically or doesn't work at all at this point, it's probably time to replace it. If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>

The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
