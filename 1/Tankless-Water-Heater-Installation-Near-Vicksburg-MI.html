With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

No matter what issue you start to encounter with your tankless water heater, you must have licensed professionals handle any fixes.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, need to heat water as it passes through.

These water heaters operate in tandem with your home heating system and are often seen in conjunction with boilers. There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>

Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
