<h2>Water Heater Services Gardner Kansas</h2>
<p>You can't just walk into your local home center and pick the cheapest water heater from the display. Kenmore makes gas and electric water heaters. Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water. This then makes textiles, cloths, papers, and wood into potential fire hazards if left carelessly near the heating element of the heater.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.

Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Gardner</h3>
