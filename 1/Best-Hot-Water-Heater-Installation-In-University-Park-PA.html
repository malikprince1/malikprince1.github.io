<h2>Water Heater Services University Park Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>The cold water will enter the tank, then the water will be heated and then the hot water will be stored until there will be demands coming from the bathroom shower or tap, or the dishwasher or kitchen sink. Solar water heaters: These water heaters use the power of the sun to heat water. Just call us and ask us, Please fix my water heater problems!” and we'll be there soon to get your hot water running normally again.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement University Park</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>The new tankless water heaters are great for providing you with hot water instantly by heating the water right inside of the pipe as soon as you turn the faucet on. While they are more expensive than traditional units, the amount of money you will save on your water bill and your electricity or gas bill will be well worth the added investment. Storage tank water heaters have an energy factor of 0.59, on average.</p>
<p>Because of their size, tankless heaters can be installed in small rooms, apartments, and any other spaces which wouldn't typically allow a tank water heater. We rely on our years of experience to decide whether repairing or replacing your existing unit is more cost-effective in the long run. In addition, there may be additional tax benefits if you install one of the Bosch tankless water heaters in your home. An electric storage heater is the least expensive to buy, but it's going to cost you more to run than a gas-powered water heater.</p>
<p>The test used an inlet temperature of 58° F for gas models and 74° F for electrics (plus or minus 2° F) and a target outlet temperature of 120° F. Water travels in pipes through solar collectors (typically installed on your roof), where it is heated by the sun. Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>

<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
