<h2>Water Heater Services Livingston California</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem.

Now, you might be thinking: A recirculation pump in combination with a tankless water heater would cause a huge waste of energy due to frequent pumping and re-heating.” And you were right, if you wouldn't make use of some type of smart control. To avoid this problem, a larger unit can be installed. So they may not be able to fit into spaces where an old heater of the same capacity could go. Tankless gas heaters are about the size of a suitcase and hang on the wall.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>

<p>When selecting a new water heater for your home, choose a water heating system that will not only provide enough hot water but also that will do so energy efficiently, saving you money. If not, building-wide pipes and water heaters will need to be fixed. Tankless water heaters produce heated water on demand, making it less wasteful, whereas a tank heater already has this hot water on hand. Sometimes you need to locate the heater so it will serve several fixtures.</p>
