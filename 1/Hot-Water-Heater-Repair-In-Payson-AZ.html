<p>While traditional water heaters will typically have a lifespan of anywhere between ten and fifteen years, most tankless units can be expected to be in use for over twenty years. The tank is heavy, so you will probably want to have some very strong rope so that you can lower the old water heater down and raise the new one up. Our tankless water heater maintenance plans can make this easier, more convenient and less expensive to do while offering you priority service as a maintenance plan member.</p>
<p>If the heating elements are good, the problem could be with the thermostats or cutoff switch. A traditional hot water heater typically holds 40-60 gallons of water that is collected in a tank and then continuously heated until it's needed.

Metals inside your water heater can rust with time and can be a cause of rusty water flow.</p>
<p>Although tankless water heaters cost a little more to install initially than regular tank systems , you'll find you'll begin to save in the long term. We have been so long in this business that we have witnessed the introduction of the first tankless water heater models in Dallas. Your actual savings depend on the type, size and energy efficiency rating of the hot water system you currently own. Accelerated Damage — the extra time that a tank spends heating water can cause the metal to turn brittle, which accelerates the likelihood of crack formation.</p>
<p>Compare the water heater's STCs for Zone 3 and for Zone 4 with the minimum requirements. Tankless water heaters last an average of 5-10 years longer than tank heaters. Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
