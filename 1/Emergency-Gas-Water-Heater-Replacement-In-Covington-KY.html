<h2>Water Heater Services Covington Kentucky</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>This is often the problem when the hot water is not heating quickly enough or there is not hot water to be had at all. Savings - 20% discount off on repairs and Indoor Air Quality services. In researching tankless water heaters you've likely come across the term cold water sandwich”. Everything must be connected precisely in order for the water heater to operate correctly and safely, which is why professional expertise is so important.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Repair Covington</h3>
<p>If the electronic ignition system breaks, the water heater won't come on and you'll end up with no hot water at all. We'll get there quickly and fix that water heater fast. However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types. For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
<p>We install tankless water heaters for commercial and residential customers in the South Bay & Los Angeles, including Torrance, Redondo Beach, Harbor City & surrounding areas. One of the biggest and least talked about drawbacks to tankless water heaters is that hard water destroys them. The beauty of investing in a tankless water heater is that it only uses energy when you are using it. When you need to take a shower, wash your hands, or do a load of laundry using warm water, the tankless water heater will heat up water on demand.</p>

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>We handle gas connections, wiring, and combustion vents to ensure that your new water heater performs optimally. The average cost of a tankless water heater installed is around $1,500-$2,000.
