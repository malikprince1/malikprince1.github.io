<p>Repair guides and support for gas and electric hot water tanks, boilers and household heat exchangers. With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks. Keep in mind, however, that most conventional gas tank water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. We install new water heaters here in Natchitoches. A new energy-efficient water heater will help save you some money in energy costs each month.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Coat the threaded ends with pipe joint compound and screw the first nipple into the gas valve.
