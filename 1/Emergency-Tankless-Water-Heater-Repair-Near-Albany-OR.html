<h2>Water Heater Services Albany Oregon</h2>

Incorrect installation will cost you money, will decrease the life of the system, and may cause the warranty to be voided. Your Dr. Energy Saver dealer can evaluate your home and your water heating system to help you determine what the best options are for your needs. You can be assured your local plumbing company is up-to-date with all local code requirements and safe installation practices: Local plumbers know when and how to pull a permit.</p>
<p>3. If you are not getting the same hot water as you used to, then you probably need a new heater or to at least have it checked. Like our other services, your new water heater will be backed by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. There are several key operational differences between tankless and conventional heaters. When you're enjoying quality family time, the last thing you need is a plumbing emergency.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

Replacing an old hot water heater with the same type in the same spot will minimise the hot water system installation cost to as low as $250.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>

We are also happy to install a tankless water heater or upgrade your current heater.

Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
