<h2>Water Heater Services Prairie Village Kansas</h2>
<p>The plumbing system is a vital part of the home which requires care to keep it functioning properly. Getting an oversized heater is a waste of money; while heaters with too low capacity will not supply sufficient hot water. The plumbers at Ben Franklin Levittown can also recommend the precise replacement heater needed for your water heater based on how many people live in your home within the budget you set. Our specialists can install, repair, tune-up, or replace any hot water heater. This saves energy, but could also waste water.</p>
<p>Whether your current system is outdated or you need water heater installation for new construction, we carry top-of-the-line products and provide timely, affordable service throughout Chicago and the surrounding region. Traditional water heaters are constantly warming water throughout the day, even when you're not using it. Tankless units only heat what you need, efficiently, helping you save on costs. Most tankless water heaters burn either natural gas or propane fuel.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>

<p>Water is then heated by a copper heat exchanger fueled by gas or electricity, depending on your system. You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>Thanks to the coated heat exchangers, your tankless water heater will last longer and be less subject to corrosion. 7. An ineffective water heater could be the reason why your energy bill has gone up unexpectedly. Learn the warning signs of water heater failure before it happens. Tankless water heaters are a great investment for any home. 7. If you lose electrical power due to weather or brown-outs, your hot water will not function - even gas units will not ignite and warm your water.</p>
<p>Our menu of home services includes HVAC Installation, windows, plumbing, duct, and Insulation. A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank. A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>When you turn on a hot water tap in your home, either a gas burner or an electric element directly heats the cold water that travels through a pipe into the unit. One of the best plumbing appliances that we have in our homes and businesses is the water heater. VENTING: Noncondensing tankless gas heaters use stainless-steel vents that can withstand high exhaust heat. Here are a few hot water tank brands we carry and install on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The rate of hot water produced by a tankless water heater is two to five gallons per minute, depending on the heating style used. The very same holds true for refurbished tankless water heaters. Installing a water heater costs $800 and $1,506, or an average of $1,125, including the unit and labor. On average, you can expect your tankless water heater unit to last a minimum of 20 years before it needs major repairs and replacement.</p>

<p>Your water heater would routinely be splashed with water or other liquids. Note: Our Customer Service Professionals are happy to help you determine this information over the phone if you are unable to find the specifications on your current water heater. Gas hot water problems or electric hot water heater problems can sometimes be easily fixed. A small, air-source heat pump installed on top of the hot water storage tank pumps hot, pressurized refrigerant compound into a heat exchanger located in or around the hot water tank.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures. Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters. Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>
<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>Also known as instant heaters, they do not produce the standby energy losses you are likely to find with traditional heaters, thereby saving you money. To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
<p>Our experienced plumbing technicians can help with everything from emergency water heater repairs to installations and replacements. Some people desire gas hot water replacement to take advantage of lower energy bills. Never attempt to do your own water heater repairs.
