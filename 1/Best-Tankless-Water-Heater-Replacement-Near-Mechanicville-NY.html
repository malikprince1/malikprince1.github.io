When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution.

Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
<p>Small apartments or limited use, such as in the case of having a single source for hot water access, may benefit from a single-point hot water tank. Tankless heaters last up to twenty-five years or more. Call (630) 577-9241 or (815) 609-1859 to discuss your water heater installation options.
