<h2>Water Heater Services Sharpsburg Georgia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>The climate can also affect how much the homeowner can save by opting for a tankless water heater. When it comes to your water heater, Radiant plumbers are equipped to perform maintenance, repairs, replacements, and also hot water heater installations. Tankless Water Heaters are much different from the traditional water heaters we have today. For example, electrical units don't need ventilation, so there's no need to install a ventilation line alongside a water line like you would with a gas unit.</p>
<p>Coat the threaded ends with pipe joint compound and screw the first nipple into the gas valve. We've taken a closer look at the best tank versus tankless heaters so you can narrow your search and find the perfect water heater for your home and lifestyle. Periodic water heater maintenance can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Water heaters are heavy. The fuel used by a water heating system will not only affect annual operation costs but also the water heater's size and energy efficiency.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Sharpsburg</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater. Keep in mind that the tank size you need should be based on the maximum amount of hot water you will need during busy times, not on the storage room available for it. In some cases, you may have to switch to an outdoor model is the size you need can't be accommodated in the space available inside your home. There are several different factors worth considering before purchasing a new water heater.</p>
<p>Petri Plumbing & Heating, Inc. Tankless water heaters heat only the water you use, rather than heating and storing water continuously. That being said, although it is a simple process, dealing with gas or electricity and water should always be handled by a professional. A like-for-like gas water heater system installation in the same spot will typically have a gas hot water heater installation cost between $250 and $700.</p>
<p>That isn't a problem with us. We know all of the proper procedures for gas water heater repairs. Finally, your installer or electrician can connect your new tankless water heater to your home's electrical systems. The water doesn't pool in the tank as it does with a standard tank type of water heater where it must fill the tank to a certain level before the heating element even starts. No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Sharpsburg GA</h3>
<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>TIP: Turn your water heater off two hours in advance to allow the water to cool. Gauging an everyday tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. The idea of refurbishing items and the selling them is nothing new to the market place, but it isn't a good idea to purchase them when it comes to particular products including tankless water heaters. The amount of time it takes to get hot water depends on how far it is from the tankless hot water heater.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you find a water damaged spot, you can trace the water stain back to the problematic leaking pipe. Allow the tank to fill completely and then turn on the electricity or gas again. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, generate hot water only when you require it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when installed in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>

<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm.
