<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater.
