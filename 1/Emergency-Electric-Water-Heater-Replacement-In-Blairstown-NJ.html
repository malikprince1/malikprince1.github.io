<p>These units can heat between 20 to 100 gallons of water. With this type of water heater, a huge amount of hot water can heated as needed instead of storing it in a tank. As such, rather than limiting your business's capabilities to the capacities of your storage tanks, a tankless water heater provides you with an infinite supply of hot water. But if the heater is already too old, and leakage is impossible to repair, then this will definitely mean replacement.</p>
