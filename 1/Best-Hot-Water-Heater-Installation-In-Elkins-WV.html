Now, you might be thinking: A recirculation pump in combination with a tankless water heater would cause a huge waste of energy due to frequent pumping and re-heating.” And you were right, if you wouldn't make use of some type of smart control. To avoid this problem, a larger unit can be installed. So they may not be able to fit into spaces where an old heater of the same capacity could go.
