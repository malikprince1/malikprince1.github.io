<h2>Water Heater Services Arden North Carolina</h2>
<p>Let's face it, unless you have invested in the new state-of-the-art tankless systems, water heaters take up a lot of space. The less water you use, the more efficient your tankless water heater will be. That's why these systems are ideal for vacation homes and families that use less water. Replaced 75 gallon electric water heater with rheem 75 gallon Marathon with a lifetime warranty. Most homeowners don't give much thought to the water heater until it goes out. Age - The serial number on the water heater should also contain the date of manufacture, which will give you the heater's age.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously.
