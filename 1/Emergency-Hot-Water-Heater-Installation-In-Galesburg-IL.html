<h2>Water Heater Services Galesburg Illinois</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly.

Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
