<p>Gas hot water heaters are one of the most common forms of hot water heater in both residential and commercial spaces. Energy-efficient tankless water heaters fit right into our wheelhouse and deliver an endless supply of hot water. Tankless water heaters will save you money, save you space, provide an unlimited amount of hot water, remove the risk of flooding, last longer than traditional water heaters, and can lead to government rebates.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
