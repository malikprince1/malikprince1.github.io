<h2>Water Heater Services Lizella Georgia</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>If your heater is in an inconvenient spot or a tight space, a tankless system might be able to help you out. It takes 60-70 minutes to heat a 100-gallon tank (recovery rate) with gas. Step 2. Turn off the gas going to the water heater at the valve that connects to the front of the water heater. According to HomeAdvisor , it can take up to 20 years for your tankless heater to pay for itself with energy bill savings.</p>
