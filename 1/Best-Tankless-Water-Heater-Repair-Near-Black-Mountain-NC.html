<h2>Water Heater Services Black Mountain North Carolina</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>Your hot water heater controls the water temperature of your home or business. In a gas powered setup the components include an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, a gas control valve and a thermocouple.

Most noises are caused by sediment that builds up in the water tank over the years—so if you're hearing a lot of bangs, creaks, knocks, or whines, it may be a sign that it's past time for flushing.</p>

If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on.
