<p>One of the most common investments a homeowner finds themselves required to make in a home is a new water heater. Many people are now going to tankless or on-demand hot water heaters simply because they are more energy efficient and use water only as it is needed. Anthony PHC Kansas City helps you upgrade to an instant water heater. In the colder months, it might not be an issue with your water heater.
