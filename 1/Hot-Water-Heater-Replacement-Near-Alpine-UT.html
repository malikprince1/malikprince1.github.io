<h2>Water Heater Services Alpine Utah</h2>

Contact us today for more information about our hot water tank and water heater repair services.

<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off. This means that water heaters should be set above 115 degrees in order to prevent the build-up of the bacteria in the system. If your current water heater is old, it's likely a conventional tank water heater.</p>

You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to replace a water heater is to replace like for like. That's the equivalent of taking several showers, running the dishwasher, washing one load of laundry, and turning the faucet on and off multiple times,” says John Banta, an engineer who oversees our water heater tests.

<p>If the water heater is too small, it will not provide enough hot water, and it will continuously run to create more hot water, which can cause the heater to fail prematurely and increase your energy bills. In order to check or replace a water heater element you will have to turn off the breaker serving the water heater circuit and remove the access cover on the water heater. A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>
<p>If you have the wrong pipe or electrical fittings you will have to return to the hardware store causing delays of the installation process. If you can and choose to do the job yourself, you should know how to shut off the water to your house (see How to Shut Off the Water to Fixtures ) and how to cut into and connect new fittings and pipes to your supply pipes (if you have copper pipes, see Cutting & Joining Copper Pipe ).</p>
<p>Turn OFF the electricity to your water heater at the circuit breaker panel. Replacing your tankless water heating unit should not have to happen often since these models typically last 20 years.

<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years.
