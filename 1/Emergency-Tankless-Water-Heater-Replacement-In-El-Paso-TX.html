<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation El Paso</h3>
<p>The optimal size of a water heater is based on the number of occupants in the house and the peak water demand. This means that tankless water heaters don't produce the same standby energy losses that traditional units do while they keep standing water warm and ready for use, which can save you hundreds of dollars on your energy bills. Rarely, both elements will test OK, but you're still not getting hot water.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
<p>When you turn on a hot water faucet for the first time in a few hours, you may find yourself waiting impatiently for 30 seconds or more for the water to heat up. Once it starts coming out hot, it stays that way for a while. It is virtually impossible to repair a leaking hot water heater. Also, you will save money because the tankless water heater doesn't have a tank. However, the type of water heater you need for your home will greatly depend on what fuel type you already have.</p>
<p>At Premier Plumbing we help you make the right decision based your needs so you know that the water heater you buy is the right one for your home or business at the lowest cost possible. Water heaters can break and leak for various reasons but some of the main problems are the water pressure is too high, a loose drain valve, wear and tear.

Even if you have an existing gas line, it may need to be upgraded to a bigger pipe in order to accommodate the power needed to fuel the tankless unit.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker. This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes. Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute. We will help you choose a water heater that is more energy-efficient and one that will work for your specific water needs.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up.

Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
