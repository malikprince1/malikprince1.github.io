<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible. Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater.

Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>
