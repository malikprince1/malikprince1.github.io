<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time.

Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
