<p>The installation of a water heater depends on the selected system. I highly recommend Epic for any plumbing or hot water repairs you might need.

Unless you are quite confident in your skills, it's best to let a professional handle water heater installation. In 2015 from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy published findings on the total cost over 13 years for many different water heaters.
