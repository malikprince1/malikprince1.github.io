<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank.

Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
