Most traditional water heaters sit in a closet for easy access; tankless models may need to have an access door added nearby in case of future issues to allow quick repair. Set up your tankless water heater installation in the Pittsburg and Antioch, CA area today. A whole house unit would be installed in a central location and completely replaces a standard tank water heater. Ideally, a full flush will be performed, but in which case the heater has to be turned off beforehand and the tank has to be full.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, tankless hot water heaters can be installed on most flush wall surfaces, as long as they have access to fuel and water lines (which should already be taken care of). A point-of-use (POU) electric tankless water heater should not be a problem in terms of amperage requirements.

Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
