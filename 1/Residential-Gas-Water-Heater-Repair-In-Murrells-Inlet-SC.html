A water heater is basically a household appliance that consists of a gas or electric heating unit under a tank in which water is heated and stored.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down.

Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>Also, if you live in an area where most of the homes are upgrading to tankless units, it may be a good idea to do the same so your property remains in competitive with the rest of the area homes (from a real estate standpoint).

Traditional heaters often require replacement at the first sign of failure.</p>

You may run into legal problems if you try to convert your home to a tankless water heater system without the proper permits.
