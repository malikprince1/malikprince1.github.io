This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement.
