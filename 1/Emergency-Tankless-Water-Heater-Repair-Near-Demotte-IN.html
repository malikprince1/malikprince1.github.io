<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Repair Demotte</h3>
<p>We've got over 30 years of experience with tankless water heater installation, tankless water heater replacement and tankless water heater repairs. Many homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters in order to save on water, energy, money and space. 1)When a hot water faucet is opened this causes water to flow through the tankless unit. Rheem water heaters are available in multiple sizes and with multiple warranties, with energy-efficiency claims that vary by size.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day.

Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient.
