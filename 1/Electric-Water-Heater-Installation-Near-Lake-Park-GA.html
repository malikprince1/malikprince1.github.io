<h2>Water Heater Services Lake Park Georgia</h2>
<p>Paloma tankless hot water heaters are among the popular choices out there. On the other hand, tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, do not rely on preheated water. Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel. From our experience in both commercial water heater repair and those of private homes, we have identified various reasons leading to regular repairs and fixed them for our clients. By installing a unit that's similar to a standard tank water heater, you can experience hot water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years.

The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute.
