<h2>Water Heater Services Corning New York</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Typically a 30-40 gallon heater is appropriate for a family of up to four, and a 50-80 gallon tank is appropriate if there are five or more people in the household.

Our New Jersey plumbers can provide you with an honest assessment of your water heater to determine if the unit can still be repaired or if it's time for a replacement.</p>
<p>An especially significant motivation is the 50% reduced heating costs over using a hot water tank.

<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
<p>If you have a gas hot water heater, the pilot light might go out and leave you without hot water. Our Lombard water heater installers will assess the problem and present you with accurate solutions.

For a place that uses a lot of hot water and more then one outlet at one time then you do not want to get the standard tankless water heater. You could have an undersized heating element(s), failed element, a 240V heater wired to 120V service, etc.</p>
