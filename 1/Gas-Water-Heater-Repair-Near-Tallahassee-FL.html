<h2>Water Heater Services Tallahassee Florida</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>There are many components to a gas or electric water heater that may require adjustment to restore hot water to your home. The average water heater has a lifespan of 12 years. But those perks may not be enough for some people to offset the extra purchase cost and installation expense. Electric tankless products do work in cold climates. If you have a small drip or a leak coming out of your water heater, it's very important to get a plumber over right away.</p>
<p>Check that your electrical supply will adequately reach the tank. Black Pipe Fittings - You may need a few ½ black pipe couplings and elbows to extend or shorten the gas line connecting to the heater. Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular due to the energy savings and consistent flow of hot water. Tankless models cost up to three times as much as a tank water heater, but they more than compensate for it with their unique benefits.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Tallahassee</h3>

New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>

The beauty of investing in a tankless water heater is that it only uses energy when you are using it. When you need to take a shower, wash your hands, or do a load of laundry using warm water, the tankless water heater will heat up water on demand.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Tallahassee FL</h3>
<p>Modern units are much more energy efficient however, so consider the money you will save on utility costs when deciding whether to repair or replace yours. Have an assistant help load the old water heater onto the appliance dolly and remove the old unit. In other installations, the solar tank is set up alongside an existing hot water tank, and the solar water preheats water for the main hot water tank. Our water heater repairs and replacements are reasonably priced and affordable, so you can rest assured that we won't bring you any hidden surprises.</p>
<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>
