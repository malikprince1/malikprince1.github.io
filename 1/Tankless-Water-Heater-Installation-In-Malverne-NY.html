However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>

Having been the industry standard for home hot water, you're likely quite familiar with a tank water heater. Unlike conventional water heaters, there is no backup hot water source during these emergency situations.

<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time. They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>Depending on your tankless water heater's capacity, too many simultaneous hot water applications (such as multiple showers running) can overload your water heater. Yes, one of the main reasons we get called out to a customer's house is their water heater has broken down and isn't supplying hot water anymore. This isn't an issue with tankless water heaters. Solar, tankless systems and fuel oil systems, however, can cost as much as $1,000 or more to install.</p>
