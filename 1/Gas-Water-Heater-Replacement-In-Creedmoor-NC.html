Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters.

When it's time to take a shower, run the dishwasher, or throw a load of clothes into the washing machine, a tankless water heater will quickly heat up the water you need. This is because they only heat water when there is a demand for it, rather than keeping a large amount of water heated at all times. Tanks with larger capacity or energy-efficiency upgrades cost more.</p>
