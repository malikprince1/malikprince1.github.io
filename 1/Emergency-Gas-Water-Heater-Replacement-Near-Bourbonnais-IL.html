Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it.

<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>

The gas hot water replacement cost would be between $1000 and $2500, in a different location. The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>Electric units face even bigger changes. A tankless heater is not effective when more than two tasks are drawing from it. So it should be one at a time.
