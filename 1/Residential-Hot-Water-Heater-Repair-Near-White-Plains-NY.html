<h2>Water Heater Services White Plains New York</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>The average tankless water heater repair costs $603. A traditional water heater will last up to 10-15 years in your home before it begins to lose efficiency. It's also important to clean out the sediment filter on the heater from time to time. Large households consume a lot of hot water, especially at peak times in the mornings and evenings. This also goes for replacing an old water heater. We offer quick same day service and stock most common water heater parts.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it. Unlike other water heaters, this type of water heater does not lose energy while in standby mode, allowing you to save more money over the long-term. Ferran Services is here to answer any question you might have, determine the perfect fit for your household, and provide proper installation.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation White Plains</h3>

Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>

<p>Our technicians are thoroughly trained on nearly every brand, make and model of water heater you may have in your home, so that we can effectively assess the issues at hand and address them immediately. Your hot water heater doesn't have to be a behemoth. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.</p>
<p>Because tankless water heaters draw water from your main water line only as you need it, there is no possibility of flooding from this kind of system. The only higher percentage is heating and cooling costs. One of the lesser-known downsides of tankless water heaters is that they have difficulty achieving a lukewarm water temperature. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time might stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.</p>
<p>The type of tankless water heater chosen for any given application will depend on incoming water temperatures and building use patterns. And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs. With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>

The peak hour demand or first-hour rating (FHR) is the measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver in an hour, and the FHR is required by law to appear on the Energy Guide label.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
