<h2>Water Heater Services Troutman North Carolina</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>

While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it.

<p>Water heaters will either be gas-fired or electrically-fired. If your water takes too long to heat up after the tank is emptied, it's because your heating element is struggling.

However, one should make sure that the tank is installed in a safe place and is secured to a strong structure such as a wall in regions that are prone to earthquake, as it minimizes the chance of a gas fire happening by turning off the gas connection in the event it that the tank falls over.</p>

Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone.
