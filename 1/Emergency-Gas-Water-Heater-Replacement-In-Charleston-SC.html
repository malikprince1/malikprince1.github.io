<h2>Water Heater Services Charleston South Carolina</h2>
<p>Water heater maintenance is one of the most important yet overlooked things home owners need to be aware of. Whether residing in a fairly new or older dwelling, it is very important that you inspect the appliance at regular intervals and make sure that it is working properly. You generally have to install a tank water heater indoors, as they cannot tolerate harsh weather conditions. There are several ways that you can benefit from having a tankless water heater installed. It should be noted that, for sizing purposes, the typical worst-case scenario (the middle of winter) should be assumed for the incoming groundwater temperature to ensure adequate hot-water availability year-round.</p>
<p>There are many components to a gas or electric water heater that may require adjustment to restore hot water to your home. The average water heater has a lifespan of 12 years. But those perks may not be enough for some people to offset the extra purchase cost and installation expense. Electric tankless products do work in cold climates. If you have a small drip or a leak coming out of your water heater, it's very important to get a plumber over right away.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Installation Charleston</h3>
<p>Homeowners looking to save on water heating expenses. Most gas tankless water heaters fall between 95,000-195,000 BTUs. Now though, if you need to repair or replace your heater, both Morco and Bosch have ceased production of these models. A standard water heater has to keep a constant supply of heat to the water inside the tank in order to have it at the right temperature when you need to take a hot shower or wash the dishes.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load. The first of course is there is no storage tank to run out of hot water. For those who have gas water heaters, the problem could lie in a gas leak. If you're in the Gwinn area and experience a plumbing emergency, call Swick Home Services, we're your 24-hour emergency plumbing professionals.</p>
