Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>

Tankless coil and indirect water heaters - Indirect hot water heaters use the home's space heating system to heat water. Unlimited Hot Water: A traditional water heater will eventually run out of hot water and only work once the tank is refilled.</p>
