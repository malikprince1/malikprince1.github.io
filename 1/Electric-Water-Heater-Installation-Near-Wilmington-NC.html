<h2>Water Heater Services Wilmington North Carolina</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>To expose the elements for testing, remove the two metal covers, the insulation and the plastic covers on the side of the water heater. Your water heater will be installed the right way the first time. This maintains a positive pressure within your home and lowers your energy bills of other heating products since it does not use precious heated air while also ensuring that your water heater receives an unlimited supply of quality oxygen-rich air at all times.</p>
<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>

<p>Even with federal and local rebates, what you'll spend to buy and install a solar system can mean waiting 10 to 30 years to recover your investment costs, although solar panels and equipment are becoming less costly all the time. The liquid used in this system, often a form of antifreeze will be cycled through solar panels and then down to the hot water tank. Brass vs. plastic drain valves: These are situated near the base of the water heater for a garden hose that drains the heater.</p>
<p>The majority of people don't have their water heater stored in a conspicuous place so the color is of lesser importance and the appearance is not relevant either. On the other hand, tankless heater works in better efficient as water is heated on demand. If a heater isn't equipped with a built-in neutralizing cartridge, the installer has to add one. However, you should consider your usage preferences, energy supply, and space considerations when talking with your local water heater service provider.</p>

Convenience: Your dependable tankless water heating system means you'll have all the hot water you need for your business needs, instantly, just when you need it. Check your work by first filling the tank with water and making sure that there are no leaks in your plumbing job.</p>

<p>Hot water delay: Because the tankless systems work on-demand, it takes longer for hot water to reach the taps once they're turned on compared to a tankless system. Each tankless water heater is designed to provide a specific amount of hot water. Our plumbers can gas pipe and gas fit existing lines to new installations of gas hot water heaters. The Insurance Information Institute reports that water damage and freezing claims occur about 1.5 times for each 100 homeowner's policies per year, with an average severity of over $5000.</p>

The number of model choices can be overwhelming, but Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating takes the time to understand your needs and ensures that the water heater you select meets current city, state and national rules. Loud pops or cracks indicate that the heating element is failing and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
