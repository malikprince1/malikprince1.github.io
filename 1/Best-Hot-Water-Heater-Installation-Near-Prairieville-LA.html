<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Because this unit draws 27,000 Watts of electricity, you will need to upgrade your electric supply to a 240V, 200 Amp service. 10. You cannot run a short blast, or a fine trickle of water from the hot taps, as the tankless water heater will not activate under such a low demand flow.
