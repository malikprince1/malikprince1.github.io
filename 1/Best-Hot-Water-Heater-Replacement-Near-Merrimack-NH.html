When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

<p>Enjoy reliable water heater servicing and protection with Miracle Plumbing Inc. We have many years of experience working on all types of hot water heaters. Besides sizing the unit appropriately, I'll want to know what the manufacturer's minimum flow rate is, what type of water quality is required by the manufacturer, and exactly what the warranty covers. With a tank heater, water sits for long periods of time, and this can corrode heating elements, the inside of the tank, and the bottom often fills with sediment.</p>
