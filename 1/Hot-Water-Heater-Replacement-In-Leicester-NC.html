There is a real possibility that your home's existing gas line, gas meter, and piping are not appropriately sized to handle the high demand for gas that a tankless water heater would require.</p>

Besides sizing the unit appropriately, I'll want to know what the manufacturer's minimum flow rate is, what type of water quality is required by the manufacturer, and exactly what the warranty covers. With a tank heater, water sits for long periods of time, and this can corrode heating elements, the inside of the tank, and the bottom often fills with sediment.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater. When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem. If a professional plumber installed a closed system, it is unlikely that an expansion chamber or tank was not installed at the same time.

Then, look at every joint on the heater to make sure there is no leakages. However, the process is very easy with a tankless gas water heater. Whether you use a traditional or a tankless water heater, you need to keep an eye out for mineral buildup inside your water heater.</p>
<p>You will save a substantial amount of money using gas over electricity as the latter cost more on a per unit basis to operate.
