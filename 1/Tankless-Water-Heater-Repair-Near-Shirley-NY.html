<h2>Water Heater Services Shirley New York</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Repair Shirley</h3>
<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>The cost difference between a traditional water heater and a tankless water heater usually shows the tankless option for a whole house water heater being 2 to 3 times more expensive. Our water heater team offers all water heater services, including 24-hour emergency repairs and replacements. Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>
<p>Our founder, Bill Smith, gave us the nickname The House of Water Heaters” in 1956. However, just because your water heater is leaking, doesn't mean that it has reached the end of its life. Save Space: Once your old hot water tank is removed your new tankless water heater is simply attached to your wall. Another feature found in Houston water heater tanks is a magnesium rod known as a sacrificial anode rod Corrosion and rust are primary reasons that most tank-type water heaters fail.</p>
<p>How they work: Tank water heaters typically hold between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water (around 120 degrees Fahrenheit) in a storage tank. If the incoming water pressure is above 150 psi a pressure reducing valve must be installed upstream of the heater. Here are the biggest benefits of installing a tankless water heater in your home. These systems are capable of providing your home with unlimited hot water, all while lowering your energy bills.</p>

<p>Modern water heaters are up to 20 percent more efficient than older models, and many heat faster as well. Life expectancy: Most last more than 20 years — about twice the lifespan of storage water heaters. Try removing the heating elements and either clean or replace them. At the same time, we want you to be aware of unexpected installation aspects you could face if you choose a tankless heater so you're not caught off guard.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will cause damage to your home, you should strongly consider replacing it after 10 years (or before, if any of the following symptoms occur). With a gas heater turn the thermostat knob to the pilot setting. Tankless heaters provide continuous hot water, so gone are the days of the hot water running out mid-shower. Inadequate Water Flow: Another thing to be aware of is that if minerals build up in the tankless water heater, they can cause slow water flow from faucets and taps.</p>

<p>According to , an Energy Star tankless water heaters can save you about $100 annually. You should choose a system that will not only provide enough hot water for your entire family's needs, but also one that will be energy efficient. Tip: Look closely at the temperature knob on your water heater and look for the word "vacation." If you are gone for more than five days, turn the water heater setting to "vacation" which means your water and your heating bill will be getting some rest while you are away.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place. Before finding the right plumber, you should know everything that goes into the cost of repairing a hot water heater.</p>
