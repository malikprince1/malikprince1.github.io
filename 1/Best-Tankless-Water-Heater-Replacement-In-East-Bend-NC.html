<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
