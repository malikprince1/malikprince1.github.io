<p>Unlike hot water tanks, which run out of hot water and need to refill and continue heating, tankless water heaters continuously provide a steady stream of hot water. Heat pump water heaters - Heat pump hot water heaters move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly for providing hot water. Visual deterioration - If your water heater tank is showing visual signs of a problem, then you should consider replacing it.</p>

Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some new code requirements have changed since your w. heater was first installed. With a range between $400 and $900, the average homeowner can expect to pay $650 to have a new water heater installed professionally. The right size unit can provide endless hot water for up to two major applications at a time.
