With tankless heaters you have the benefit of an endless supply of hot water. A tankless water heater is less likely to corrode than a storage tank system, but if the pipes start to leak, corrosion can start up.

Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
