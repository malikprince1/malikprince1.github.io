<h2>Water Heater Services Coopersburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>One of the things to consider when planning a water heater installation project is the installation cost. Press the black probe firmly against the metal tank or the heating element mounting nuts or screws (not the other terminal screw). There are some elements that set each type of water heater a apart from one another. If your old water heater used copper piping, you may choose to plumb it with copper piping again.</p>
<p>While most homeowners are used to their tanked system, a tankless water heater offers improved performance while saving on energy costs. Configuration of water heater: some electrical systems and configurations may need to be updated to accommodate the voltage requirements of the new electric tankless system. Open a faucet to full "hot" to purge air from the water pipes and heater. We'll make sure the tankless heating units you select have the proper capacity and best feature set to support the hot water requirements of your specific industry.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Repair Coopersburg</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Metro PHA provides furnace maintenance and repairs for most major brands. A noisy water heater is a nuisance and can also mean there is a problem or a potential danger. We also need to know what the energy factor (EF) rating is for the water heater we have selected. This is the obvious and most common sign you need a new water heater installation.

Both tank and tankless units come with a manufacturer's warranty. If your home is space-restricted, you'll have challenges finding enough area to locate storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Older water heaters tend to have parts that wear out over time due to corrosion and rusting. Never put insulation on the tin draft diverter located above the gas water heate. Over time, the heating element may wear out. If you decide to invest in a refurbished tankless water heater system, you need to be prepared for disappointment and having to invest more money in the future. A properly sized electric tankless water heater can do this, but to do so it puts a large surge of demand on your electric service.</p>

We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>

Not only do we offer water heater repair for your home or business, but we also install water heaters, as well.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
