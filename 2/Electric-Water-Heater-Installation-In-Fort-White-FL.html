<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>Tank-type water heaters store hot water so that it's available when needed. Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation. Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>

<p>The most obvious drawback to a tankless water heater is the higher cost for both the unit and the installation. When sediment has built up inside your tank or the heating element stops working, we might be able to repair it. Elements can corrode due to a higher mineral content in the water such as you typically find with well water. Tankless water heating technology checks all the boxes to a more comfortable home.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is for any leaks or standing water near your water heater. If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections. Reliable - With a properly sized unit, you'll always have a continuous supply of hot water at a preset temperature. If you're wondering if a tankless water heater would be a good replacement for your current setup, we can also advise on the cost and benefits provided by this modern system.</p>

Our services for water heater installation also span across Bristol, Abington, Montgomery County, Bucks County, Levittown, Newtown, Bala Cynwyd, Yardley, Colmar, Doylestown, New Hope, and Upper Darby, PA. Electrical Issues: Since modern water heaters rely on electrical components to function, there's a good chance that an electrical problem with the wiring or sensors could cause the complete loss of hot water.</p>
<p>The further your water has to travel from the water heater to its destination, the more noticeable the gap. He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit. Also, as I mentioned earlier, tank-style heaters break down over time due to hard water causing the inner lining of the tank to rust and corrode.</p>

Whether your water heater is failing to produce anything but lukewarm water, has sprung a leak, or is simply outdated, Mr. Rooter Plumbing can help you find the perfect replacement for your home. However, there are levels among tankless heaters as gas-fired heaters are able to produce higher flow rates than electric models.</p>
<p>High energy bills - An old water heater may be working harder than it needs to and, in turn, raising your energy bills unnecessarily. Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
