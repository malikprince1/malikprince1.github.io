Rarely, both elements will test OK, but you're still not getting hot water.</p>

You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water. Although tankless water heaters are also called "instantaneous water heaters," they still take time to heat water, so after the trapped water was used up, you were left with a gap of unheated water.</p>
<p>With these units you do not have to store water in a standard 40 - 50 gallon tank, therefore there is no stale or stagnant water just sitting in the tank waiting to be used.
