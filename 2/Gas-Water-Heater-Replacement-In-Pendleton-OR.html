Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones.

Now, you might be thinking: A recirculation pump in combination with a tankless water heater would cause a huge waste of energy due to frequent pumping and re-heating.” And you were right, if you wouldn't make use of some type of smart control. To avoid this problem, a larger unit can be installed. So they may not be able to fit into spaces where an old heater of the same capacity could go. Tankless gas heaters are about the size of a suitcase and hang on the wall.</p>

Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
