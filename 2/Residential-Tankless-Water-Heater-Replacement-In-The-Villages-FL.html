<h2>Water Heater Services The Villages Florida</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>

<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types.
