Doctor Fix it installs all makes and models of water heaters, and can also educate you about the benefits of Tankless Water Heaters as another option for endless hot water.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house.

Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>
<p>If the element has a short, power will flow through the metal tank of the water heater. The average life span of a water heater is between 8 and 12 years. Fill the water heater and check for leaks. Our licensed plumbing experts from Mr. Rooter® Plumbing can help you determine whether a tankless water heater is right for your home.

The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>
<p>When you lose power, there is a reserve of hot water for a short time period. You have no hot water: If you don't have hot water in your home, your water heater clearly isn't working.
