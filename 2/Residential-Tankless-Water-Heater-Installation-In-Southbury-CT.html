<h2>Water Heater Services Southbury Connecticut</h2>
<p>Do your homework and you'll see that the energy efficiency factor makes finding the best tankless hot water heater worth the effort. This company makes some of the best tankless water heaters on the market. Added Property Value: Whether you're planning on selling, or looking for high-end renters for your property, a tankless water heater is a great selling point for your property. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater.</p>
<p>Tank water heaters are the most common kind of water heater. After that, the new water heater can be brought in and maneuvered into place. When setting up a space heating water heating system you need a higher output quick recovery unit for some systems, like an electric forced hot air handler serviced by a hydronic heating coil. In the end, it is putting more pressure on the water heater to work. Our maintenance free heating units help water temperatures stay at safe levels.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units. Call (805) 499-0448 today to begin your expert AC repair, installation, or replacement. Tank style water heaters generally last about ten years. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down.</p>

Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>
<p>But because these tankless gas units last longer, the savings kicks in after six years, about when many tanks are nearing their demise. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger delivering it directly to your faucets or shower without using a storage tank. Whether you're in central Austin, or a surrounding city such as Lakeway, Bee Caves, Round Rock, Westlake Hills or Georgetown, TX, there is always potential for your water heater to experience one of these issues.</p>
