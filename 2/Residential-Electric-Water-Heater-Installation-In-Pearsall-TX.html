A water heater can leak from many areas, including around the heating elements, gas control valve, drain valve, or the pipes that supply the water heater.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you find a water damaged spot, you can trace the water stain back to the problematic leaking pipe. Allow the tank to fill completely and then turn on the electricity or gas again.
