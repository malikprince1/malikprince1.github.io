<h2>Water Heater Services Platteville Wisconsin</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater.

<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types.

Tankless hot water heaters are available in propane (LP), natural gas, or electric models.</p>

<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on. There is a heating element, or several heating elements, in the pipe and as the water flows over them, it gets heated up. These appliances are easy to install, provide great value, require less maintenance and offer every member of the family an unlimited supply of instant hot water.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>

<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds.

This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
