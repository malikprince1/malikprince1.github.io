<h2>Water Heater Services Sturgis South Dakota</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use.

However, a tankless model might not be the most suitable option for you if you have a large home or use a significant amount of water daily.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>

The water inside this tank is heated up and then released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank.</p>

<p>The most obvious drawback to a tankless water heater is the higher cost for both the unit and the installation. When sediment has built up inside your tank or the heating element stops working, we might be able to repair it. Elements can corrode due to a higher mineral content in the water such as you typically find with well water. Tankless water heating technology checks all the boxes to a more comfortable home.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced. Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models. Tankless water heaters that use natural gas are about 23 percent more efficient than a traditional storage version, which is about 60 percent efficient, according to the Department of Energy.</p>
