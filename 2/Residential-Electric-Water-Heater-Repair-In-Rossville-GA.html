To prevent serious health issues from interior air contamination, gas-powered tankless water heaters require special venting to remove the hot carbon monoxide exhaust fumes and expel them to the outside air. It's usually placed in your basement, by furnace or water heater, or underneath your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>

The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
