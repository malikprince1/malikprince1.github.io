<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Because a direct vent water heater has fewer moving parts in it with fewer things to go wrong, it will carry either a 6-, 9- or 12-year warranty, whereas a powered vent water heater will typically cap out at a 6-year warranty. For those who have already bought the product, tankless water heater reviews can help in locating dealers regarding service details and provide directions in case repairs are needed.</p>
