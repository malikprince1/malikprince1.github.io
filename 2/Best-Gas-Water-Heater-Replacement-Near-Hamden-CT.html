<h2>Water Heater Services Hamden Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>

<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

Traditional tank water heaters are sold clearly marked with their capacity in gallons on a label on the tank. Propane costs an average of $350 per year to run a heater.</p>
<p>The new tankless water heaters are great for providing you with hot water instantly by heating the water right inside of the pipe as soon as you turn the faucet on.

Storage tank water heaters have an energy factor of 0.59, on average.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Hamden Connecticut 06514</h3>
<p>Make the right decision and have your water heater running the way it should. Our services for water heater installation also span across Bristol, Abington, Montgomery County, Bucks County, Levittown, Newtown, Bala Cynwyd, Yardley, Colmar, Doylestown, New Hope, and Upper Darby, PA. Electrical Issues: Since modern water heaters rely on electrical components to function, there's a good chance that an electrical problem with the wiring or sensors could cause the complete loss of hot water.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters supply hot water when you need it without the use of a storage tank. The main differences include that a direct vent heater uses an inducer motor to boost the removal of exhaust gas and can be vented with PVC pipe. Internal corrosions is most likely occurring in your water heater and it's time to consider replacing it with a more efficient, modern model. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>A tankless heater can reduce the wait time” for hot water for your shower or any other use. Safety - With tankless water heaters there is virtually no chance of your child or anyone else being scalded by hot water out of the tap. There are some common mistakes that homeowners make with their water heaters that should be avoided. If the tankless water heater doesn't properly vent out exhaust gases from the heat exchanger, it can cause the heat exchanger to corrode, and this can be potentially harmful to your house.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
