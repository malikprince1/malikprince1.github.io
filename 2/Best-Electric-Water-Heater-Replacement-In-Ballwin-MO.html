<h2>Water Heater Services Ballwin Missouri</h2>
<p>Water heater maintenance is one of the most important yet overlooked things home owners need to be aware of. Whether residing in a fairly new or older dwelling, it is very important that you inspect the appliance at regular intervals and make sure that it is working properly.

In a gas powered setup the components include an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, a gas control valve and a thermocouple.

<p>Water heaters can be a costly investment for home owners that you'll be living with for over a decade.

<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet.
