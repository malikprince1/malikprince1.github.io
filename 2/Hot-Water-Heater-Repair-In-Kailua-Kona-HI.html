Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
