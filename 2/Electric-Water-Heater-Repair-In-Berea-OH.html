<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>There are many components to a gas or electric water heater that may require adjustment to restore hot water to your home. The average water heater has a lifespan of 12 years. But those perks may not be enough for some people to offset the extra purchase cost and installation expense. Electric tankless products do work in cold climates.

<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
