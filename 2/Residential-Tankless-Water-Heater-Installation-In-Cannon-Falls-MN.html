<p>With all of the different problems that can result from having a hot water heater, it's always good to know what the most common ones are and how to handle them. If your demand is higher, then a whole house” tankless water heater or two or more tankless systems will be able to keep up with the demand of your household. When you choose to retrofit a tankless water heater in place of a storage tank variety, your plumber-installer will take more time, increasing the installed cost, of replacing a storage tank water heater because of the complexity of relocating existing piping.</p>

<p>A backup heating element is in the tank, so you'll have plenty of hot water, no matter what the weather. Tankless water heaters can also be used as a booster for dishwashers, washing machines, and as a backup for solar or wood-fired domestic systems. However, once they run out of water, users must wait for a new tank to reheat. If you're worried about installation costs, then you might want to consider electric tankless water heaters.</p>
