<p>Are you in doubt of the right Electric Tankless Water Heater to buy? We'll determine the right water heater sizing, and help you find the ideal balance of initial cost, equipment lifetime, and operating cost.

Mitchell Heating DC's specialists can help evaluate and assess your property to know which water heater works best for your property.</p>

Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>

Electric hot water tanks in the basement.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
