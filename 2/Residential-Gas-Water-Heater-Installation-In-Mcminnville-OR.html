Price with installation: Varies dramatically depending on the type, brand, your home, and whether you are installing a new heater or replacing an old one.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube.

Again we highly recommend having Hunts take care of your hot water tank repairs needs for you safety and piece of mind knowing you job was done by a pro. This will save you so much time and money. Tankless water heater, as the stated in the name, is the kind of water heating system that provides hot water without using a tank.</p>
<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly.

<p>Less efficiency — the heater will have to use more gas or electricity to heat the water. The first is that the tankless water heater that you install must have a thermal efficiency that's greater than 90%.

<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated, via electrical resistance coils or natural gas.
