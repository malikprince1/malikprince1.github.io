They also are very well insulated to conserve the heat that the tank maintains while holding heated water.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM. So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home.

If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>
