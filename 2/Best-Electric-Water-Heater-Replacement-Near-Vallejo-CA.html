<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
