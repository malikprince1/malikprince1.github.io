Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>It can be complicated removing old water heaters because they can weigh over 150 pounds and can release scalding-hot water if handled improperly. Hot water heaters are available in different models that are powered by solar energy, gas and electricity. Water leaks usually are caused by leaking valves and plumbing connections, but they can also be related to tank problems. This model of heater can serve a practically unlimited source of hot water, because it's constantly heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>This is an important and a safety component of a hot water heater tank. The conventional heater and storage tank that is installed mostly in garages has undergone some very good improvements that make them much more efficient with a faster recovery period and with less gas or electricity usage. It's just that some water heaters come with a filter screen at the cold water inlet that requires cleaning every once in a while.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
