<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Lithia</h3>
<p>Tankless: Tankless water heaters tend to cost more up front than storage tank models. Hot water heaters come in all shapes and sizes, some fueled by natural gas or oil, some by electricity or propane. If these tanks are replaced with tankless hot water heaters, newfound space can be converted into another resident amenity, such as on-site storage or laundry, both of which can bring in extra revenue. Most heaters are not sold with these jackets in place so a lot of heat can be lost through the tanks body.</p>
<p>Prices vary depending on the option purchased, but the average price on these heaters is about $500. While you look for a unit, consider the following things: fuel types (gas or electric, unit type (tank or tankless), the length and coverage or warranty, how many people live in your home, long-term maintenance requirements, and operating costs.

The gas tankless water heater installation cost would also be in the $250 and $700 range to replace an old tankless system with the same type in the same spot. This type of heater depends on the application and the availability of the other types.</p>
