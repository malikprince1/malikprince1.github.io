<h2>Water Heater Services Philipsburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries. A tankless water heater will last about twenty(20) years, while a conventional water heater may only last ten(10) to thirteen(13) years or less (depending on the quality of your water).

<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute. Tankless water heaters operate by turning on as a hot water tap or appliance is activated, heating the water through a heat exchanger as it is moved to the faucet, dishwasher, washing machine, or shower head.

<p>This is because the water is flowing through the heating department without being heated to a particular temperature.

<p>Space: These units have a much smalller footprint because they don't have a huge tank attached. You can reclaim the space that was previously taken by a large hot water heater tank.

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>

Rather than keeping a large tank of water warm around-the-clock until you need it, tankless water heaters rapidly heat the water you require right when you need it. This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
