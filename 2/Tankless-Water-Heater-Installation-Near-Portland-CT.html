A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Check that your electrical supply will adequately reach the tank. Black Pipe Fittings - You may need a few ½ black pipe couplings and elbows to extend or shorten the gas line connecting to the heater. Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular due to the energy savings and consistent flow of hot water. Tankless models cost up to three times as much as a tank water heater, but they more than compensate for it with their unique benefits.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>

Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
