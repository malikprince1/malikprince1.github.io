<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus.

<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>

A gas water heater, if installed inside the house, will need to have a gas pipe run to its heating system to fuel the burners that are used to heat up the passing water.</p>

When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are not a simple swap out.” Most conventional gas water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. No storage tank saves valuable space. The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity. When you turn the hot water tap in a home with a tankless water heater, a powerful gas or electric heater kicks on and instantly heats water running through coils in the unit.</p>
