<h2>Water Heater Services Peoria Arizona</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500.
