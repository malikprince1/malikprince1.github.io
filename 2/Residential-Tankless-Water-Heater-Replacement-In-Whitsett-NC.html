<h2>Water Heater Services Whitsett North Carolina</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Here at Althoff, we have professional plumbers that can install any size water heater for residential and commercial buildings, and they have the knowledge, experience and skill to pull the required permits and properly install the water heater. If you are finding that your water is not getting hot enough or that it is running out quickly, it could be time for a new heating element for your water heater.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, tankless hot water heaters can be installed on most flush wall surfaces, as long as they have access to fuel and water lines (which should already be taken care of). A point-of-use (POU) electric tankless water heater should not be a problem in terms of amperage requirements. VIP Plumbing's team is ready to provide the service, repair or replace your existing boiler with a high-efficiency system from Navien or Weil-Mclain to improve your Solon home comfort and lower your utility and fuel costs.</p>

A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Whitsett North Carolina 27377</h3>
<p>No matter what size water heater you need for your home or business, our expert plumbers will install the correct hot water heater so you will never run out of hot water again. Helpful for diagnostics, it has blinking lights that inform you or the service person about the water heater's status. To better serve you, we have over 500 tankless heater parts on our truck and over 5,000 in stock. However, many wonder if a tankless model is the right style of hot water heater for their home.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
<p>Natural-gas water heaters typically use less energy and cost less to run (by about half) than electric water heaters, although you should note that gas models cost more at the time of purchase. We also provide emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When properly maintained, tankless water heaters often have a lifespan of at least 20 years (approximately twice that of conventional storage tanks).</p>
<p>Although tankless water heaters cost a little more to install initially than regular tank systems , you'll find you'll begin to save in the long term. We have been so long in this business that we have witnessed the introduction of the first tankless water heater models in Dallas. Your actual savings depend on the type, size and energy efficiency rating of the hot water system you currently own. Accelerated Damage — the extra time that a tank spends heating water can cause the metal to turn brittle, which accelerates the likelihood of crack formation.</p>
<p>Once you have placed the new water heater in the compartment, installed your hot and cold connections, connected your gas supply line, and connected the pressure relief line, you are ready to fill the tank. Your water heater works silently around the clock to give you a constant supply of warm water. Look out for the energy factor (EF) too, as this indicates how well the unit can converts its fuel to heat. Water quality is an important consideration for all water equipment, and water heaters will often be impacted the most.</p>
