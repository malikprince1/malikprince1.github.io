<h2>Water Heater Services Hempstead Texas</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>

<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Hempstead</h3>
<p>This system is also known as "demand water heaters" as they provide hot water only when needed. But there is one caveat: Because a tankless water heater heats the water real-time as the water moves through the unit, it can only heat a given amount of water at one time. Most noises are caused by sediment that builds up in the water tank over the years—so if you're hearing a lot of bangs, creaks, knocks, or whines, it may be a sign that it's past time for flushing.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations.
