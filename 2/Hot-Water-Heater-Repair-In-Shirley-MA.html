<h2>Water Heater Services Shirley Massachusetts</h2>

We work within your budget along with your family size and fixture usage to complete the perfect tankless water heater installation. Our water heater repair and replacement specialists have the tools, skills, and experience needed to help with any water heater or plumbing related need. While we can help you with all your plumbing repair needs, we also offer maintenance programs that can reduce the risk of emergencies and keep the water flowing day after day.</p>
<p>The Energy Factor (EF) rating on the label will tell you have efficient the hot water heater is at transferring heat from the energy source to the water. If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation. Consumer Reports recently tested several electric and gas whole-house tankless water heaters from brands such as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Repair Shirley</h3>
<p>Even with federal and local rebates, what you'll spend to buy and install a solar system can mean waiting 10 to 30 years to recover your investment costs, although solar panels and equipment are becoming less costly all the time. The liquid used in this system, often a form of antifreeze will be cycled through solar panels and then down to the hot water tank. Brass vs. plastic drain valves: These are situated near the base of the water heater for a garden hose that drains the heater.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>
<p>We have a range of gas and electric tank water heaters provided in several sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation.

<p>Cold climate tankless water heaters may require extra labor to install. Energy isn't wasted heating water that can sit in a tank for hours or days. The tank water heater has been the primary mode of heating water for decades now and this method of water heating has gone unchallenged, until now. One of the biggest risks with tank-style heaters is, over time, minerals from hard water build-up within the tank which leads to corrosion and eventually leaks.</p>

<p>Tankless hot water heaters are also a good choice for most retro projects, and should be considered a good choice for second homes and weekend retreats where the percentage of standing hot water is wasted.

Age of the Heating Unit: The average life of a water heater is about 8 to 12 years.</p>
<p>Scale can build up on the heating elements causing all sorts of noises to occur while heating. Our company provides prompt and efficient services with warranty for installation and repair. If possible, get a water heater with a separate anode rod, which will usually have a hex head on top where the anode screws into the tank. Most electric water heaters have two heating elements. Most water heaters, including tankless water heaters and natural gas tankless water heaters, have an expected service life of no more than 10 to 13 years, depending on system use, local water chemistry and maintenance provided.</p>

Now connect the garden hose to the bottom of the water heater and run the hose to nearby floor drain. A specialty of tankless water heaters is that they never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
