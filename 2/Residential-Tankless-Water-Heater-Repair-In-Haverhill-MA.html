Click the links below to learn about tankless water heaters. If you're like most homeowners, you rarely service your water heater. Tankless hot water heaters are a completely different breed.

Not only will it help you lower your energy costs, but also it can help you save space in your home.

<p>A tankless water heater warms up water as it passes through, eliminating the need for a bulky water storage container. Tank-type water heaters consume energy on an ongoing basis to keep water hot in a tank. Sizing a regular tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. Logic suggests that if you pay to heat water only at those peak times, it must cost less than heating water all the time. After you have had your unit looked at by the specialist, they will probably suggest that you either repair or replace your heater.</p>
<p>Water heaters can be a costly investment for home owners that you'll be living with for over a decade. The final cost of having a water heater repaired will depend on the age of your water heater, the type of water heater, the scope of the problem and whether additional repairs to the natural gas supply, plumbing or electrical systems are needed. Tankless water heaters usually last 5 to 10 years longer than standard heaters.</p>
<p>The following guide explains how to install an electric tankless water heater step by step. These units heat faster and are more economical than standard electric models. Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>
