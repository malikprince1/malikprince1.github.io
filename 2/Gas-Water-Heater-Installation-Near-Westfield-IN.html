<h2>Water Heater Services Westfield Indiana</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services. We have provided outstanding plumbing services since 1980 and have plenty of experience with all types of water heaters. To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>The Energy Factor (EF) rating on the label will tell you have efficient the hot water heater is at transferring heat from the energy source to the water. If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation. Consumer Reports recently tested several electric and gas whole-house tankless water heaters from brands such as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless.</p>
<p>Clean the pipes beforehand with steel wool if you want to reduce the amount of buildup in the water heater, but it is not required as there is only a little bit of deposit that could get into the heater from copper tubing. Water heaters must be properly maintained. We fix all makes and models—including both standard and tankless water heaters. However told my wife he would have to get replacement faucet and hot and cold knobs.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Westfield</h3>
<p>If the electronic ignition system breaks, the water heater won't come on and you'll end up with no hot water at all. We'll get there quickly and fix that water heater fast. However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater doesn't use a storage tank to heat water. The most popular style of new water heaters on the market is the tankless water heater. Another maintenance procedure will include checking on the gas connections leading into the heater. Whether you have a gas, electric, or tankless water heater, we can help. As the treatment chemicals from the city are heated in your water heater, calcium forms, causing buildup.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are the newest and most important innovation in water heater technology. If your old water heater used copper piping and it was necessary to cut the pipes, you will need to prepare the pipes using sandpaper cloth. If this sounds all too familiar, your water heater may need repaired or replaced. Our selection of high-quality brand name and ENERGY STAR® certified water heaters provide hot water to your home in a variety of methods, to fit any need.</p>

<p>Whenever you need service related to water heaters in Atlanta, R.S. Andrews has the plumbing contractor experts to help. When choosing a tankless water heater, you generally have the option of a large or small unit. Tankless water heaters, also referred to as on-demand water heaters, generate hot water only when you require it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>Check for leaks by turning on the gas supply valve and brushing a soapy water solution onto the gas union and all gas joints. Not only are they highly efficient, but they can also save you money by heating water only on-demand. Used for decades in Europe where living space is at a premium, tankless water heaters are a safe and reliable way to use less energy. What can go wrong: A single tankless heater may not have sufficient capacity to supply hot water to multiple locations at the same time.</p>
<p>Your tankless hot water heater will provide as much or as little hot water as is needed at any given time. For every 2 water tanks you install, you only have to get 1 tankless water heater. Plus, improperly installed electric water heaters can leak steam that causes mold growth and water damage. Here we will install an electric model, which is less complicated to put together than a gas one. With its installation, purchasers also need to think about the plumbing connection of their houses.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters, also referred to as on-demand water heaters, generate hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater. Space Savers: Tankless water heater installation is more convenient because these small systems can easily be installed under a sink or in a cabinet - taking a fraction of the space of your traditional system.</p>
<p>Save money, improve efficiency of your heating system with our professional water heater and tankless water heater installation and repair services. They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>The largest gas models, which may provide all the needs of an entire household, are usually installed centrally. Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
