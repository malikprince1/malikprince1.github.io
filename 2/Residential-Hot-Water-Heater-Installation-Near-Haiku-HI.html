A water heater is basically a household appliance that consists of a gas or electric heating unit under a tank in which water is heated and stored.</p>
<p>It takes a good amount of time for the tank to fill back up, turn on the burner, and heat the water. In a gas based tankless system, the gas heater is responsible for heating the water. If you answered no” to one or more of these questions, especially, question #1, you should probably hold off and stick with a tank-style heater. We can relocate your water heater if needed. After you are sure that everything is connected back properly, open the valve to fill the tank up, while this is happening i would open up a few hot water faucets just to get some of the air out.</p>
<p>If it doesn't ignite, leave the hot water running and try lowering and then raising the temperature setting on the dial until the burner ignites.

Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
