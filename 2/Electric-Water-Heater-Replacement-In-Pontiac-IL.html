<h2>Water Heater Services Pontiac Illinois</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>However, if properly maintained, electric tankless water heaters can last between 10 and 15 years. Condensing water heaters are a highly efficient type of water heater for homes that heat with gas and require a capacity of more than 55 gallons. Doctor Fix It will repair or replace the water heater for the lifetime of the water heater at no cost to you. As a certified TVA contractor, we'll ensure that you get full credit for your tankless water heater installation.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>The new Federal Water Heater Energy Standards have produced a burst of energy in new water heater design and technology Here's a cool Infographic from the U.S. Department of Energy.

In electric water heaters, if hot water comes out for a very short span of time, the first thing to check is the thermostat setting. No storage or holding tank means that tankless water heaters have a life span twice as long as traditional systems because the risk of rust and corrosion is significantly lower.</p>
<p>Our team of experienced plumbers is trained to fix a range of problems, one of which is water heater repairing. Over time, sediment from the water settles on the bottom of the tank. A tankless water heater will save you money since it provides instant heating when hot water is needed rather than constantly heating and reheating the same water until it is used.

Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air. With a replacement, you can have a water heater that doesn't require frequent repairs, and you can have a more energy efficient water heater. Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
