<h2>Water Heater Services Swarthmore Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Your water heater is one of the single most expensive components of your plumbing system.

Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Swarthmore</h3>
<p>We'll take a look at some potential water heater malfunctions below. However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure whether a repair or replacement is the best option, we offer free second opinions when you have a written estimate from another water heater service. Your water heater is noisy.

<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>Cold climate tankless water heaters may require extra labor to install. Energy isn't wasted heating water that can sit in a tank for hours or days. The tank water heater has been the primary mode of heating water for decades now and this method of water heating has gone unchallenged, until now. One of the biggest risks with tank-style heaters is, over time, minerals from hard water build-up within the tank which leads to corrosion and eventually leaks.</p>

<p>Fischer Plumbing can assist with all of your tankless hot water heater needs. Traditional tank water heaters store the water in a tank or boiler until it is needed. The good news is that electric water heaters don't need venting. While many water heaters have a long service life in your home, these important pieces of equipment do not last forever. This way you will cut the installation costs. When the hot water tap is turned off, the water heater turns off.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>

No longer will you have to wait for hot water, wasting gallons at a time. If you combine that with a regular maintenance routine you can add years to your water heater's service life. List the phone numbers to preferred local handyman services, water damage restoration companies, pest control companies, electricians, roofing companies, plumbers, carpet cleaners, home improvement contractors, and so on.
