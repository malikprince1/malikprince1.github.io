<h2>Water Heater Services Irvine Kentucky</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>The water heater produces loud popping or cracking noises during use. So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>

That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
