<p>When you need to repair your water heater and you have forgotten where you put your warranty or manual, it helps to have some tips to guide you along the way. You don't want to have to deal with issues with your water heater installation such as having to re-install it, leaks, or having to spend money to replace it. The certified, experienced plumbing professionals at Putman & Son's Plumbing will do the job right the first time around, ensuring that you don't have to deal with costly repairs or mistakes that will end up being a major inconvenience in the future if they lead to water heater issues or leaks.</p>
<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Emmaus</h3>
<p>If you have been looking to cut on your energy bills, replacing your old water tank heater and upgrading to a tankless heater is the way to go.

Our plumbers can inspect and troubleshoot, and also offer maintenance services to help limit the risk of repair issues down the road.</p>
<p>The new tankless water heaters are great for providing you with hot water instantly by heating the water right inside of the pipe as soon as you turn the faucet on.
