There is a heating mechanism at the bottom that heats the water which then rises to the top of the tank. Hot water tanks are rated for their Energy Factor” (EF) which measures how much hot water is produced per unit of fuel.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>

If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration. However, tankless water heaters are becoming standard in new developments, so if you live in a newer home or a home that has recently been remodeled, you may have a tankless system supplying hot water to your home.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>
