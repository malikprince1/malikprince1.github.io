<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water. There are different brand names of tankless water heaters to choose from since this kind of home appliances is in demand in the market with different designs, sizes and features.</p>

Tankless Water Heater: If you're looking for a more energy-efficient alternative to a gas water heater, a tankless water heater could be the right choice for your home. We will assess your current and future hot-water requirements and the condition of the pipes and drains that connect to your water heater.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>
<p>As opposed to the more traditional way of heating water with a water tank, the wait is far less for the water to heat up and stays hotter for longer while using less energy. A family that needs frequently needs a large volume hot water (running the shower, dishwasher, and washing machine at the same time, for example), may find that a tankless water heater can't supply enough hot water to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Because water heaters are in constant contact with water, it's common for them to deteriorate over time. The overall cost of owning a water heater will depend on a number of factors such as the number of people using the heater, operating expenses, and remodeling done in the home. Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
