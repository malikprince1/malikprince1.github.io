<h2>Water Heater Services Danville Virginia</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill.

Because tankless water heaters are a compact size, they don't take up a lot of space. They save energy (and save you money), they provide unlimited hot water, they're small and compact, they never leak and don't contribute to harmful metals in your water.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>

<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>

Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>You may also need to wire in the new water heater unless you're lucky enough to have a properly sized power source nearby. After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials. Next if your heater came with a T&P valve unbox it and pipe dope those threads.</p>
<p>Electric units face even bigger changes. A tankless heater is not effective when more than two tasks are drawing from it. So it should be one at a time. This valve is supposed to shut off the water heater's heating element once the water reaches a certain pressure. Our attention to detail, honesty, integrity and by providing professional services have made us one of the most popular choices in the Chattanooga metropolitan area.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated, via electrical resistance coils or natural gas.

Some of these issues can be addressed by installing a tankless water heater. For expert water heater repair in the Orange County area, look to your neighbors at Barker and Sons Plumbing & Rooter.</p>
