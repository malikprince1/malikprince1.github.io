<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>Older water heaters tend to have parts that wear out over time due to corrosion and rusting. Never put insulation on the tin draft diverter located above the gas water heate. Over time, the heating element may wear out. If you decide to invest in a refurbished tankless water heater system, you need to be prepared for disappointment and having to invest more money in the future. A properly sized electric tankless water heater can do this, but to do so it puts a large surge of demand on your electric service.</p>

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Andrews South Carolina 29510</h3>
<p>Noritz has been an innovator in the water heating industry for over 60 years. This way the cold water can flow back to the heater through the cold water line. Mr. Electric service professionals are trained and experienced in installing tankless water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters come in three different types : non-condensing, condensing, non-condensing hybrid. By only heating water when it's needed, tankless water heaters do not experience standby heat loss, which occurs when heat escapes the water tank and needs constant reheating.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>If a gas line has to be added or relocated, then a plumbing permit may be required for the modifications or changes; note that just one permit may cover both the water heater and plumbing modifications. Persistent noises: Sometimes the tank makes noises because the heating element is burning out. Since PSE&G is not a Licensed Master Plumber, we use authorized licensed installers to provide the optional WorryFree Water Heater Replacement Service.</p>
<p>That means we know how to quickly and reliably provide tankless water heater repair service no matter what type of problem your hot water heater has. We can also recommend a preventive maintenance plan that will keep your water heater in working order. As the water flows across the heating elements, it gets hot. Age is the most common reason your water heater will need to be replaced, though consistent problems with leaks and sediment build-up may require more than just repairs.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
