Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water. There are different brand names of tankless water heaters to choose from since this kind of home appliances is in demand in the market with different designs, sizes and features.</p>

In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

Most tankless water heaters require disconnect switches, which should be installed next to the water heater.</p>
<p>These units can heat between 20 to 100 gallons of water. With this type of water heater, a huge amount of hot water can heated as needed instead of storing it in a tank.
