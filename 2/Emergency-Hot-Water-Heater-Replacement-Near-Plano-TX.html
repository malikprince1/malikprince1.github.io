<h2>Water Heater Services Plano Texas</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Your contractor does not require any special training or previous experience with tankless water heaters. Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of monthly utilities. We perform all types of hot water heater repair services, from routine tank flushes and heating element replacement to leaking pipes. The traditional storage tank hot water heaters are generally going to provide most people the gallons per minute of water they desire.</p>
<p>When the hot water tap is activated, cold water travels through a pipe into the tankless unit, where either a gas or electric element delivers heat. When it comes to tankless water heaters there really is nothing we can't do and do really well. Removing your current water heater cost anywhere from $100 to $500. The most common issues that occur in regards to tankless water heaters are system overload, mineral buildup, flame failure, or an exhaust blockage.</p>

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>

Our technicians have specialized training in tankless systems, which means we can address the areas of installation, repair, and replacement with equal confidence. Gas fired tankless systems produce hot water at a higher flow rate than electric tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>Natural gas units are the least expensive choice and are powered from a city utility supply which costs an average of $200 per year. Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>
