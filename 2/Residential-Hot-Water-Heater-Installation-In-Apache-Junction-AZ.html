<p>When you need to repair your water heater and you have forgotten where you put your warranty or manual, it helps to have some tips to guide you along the way. You don't want to have to deal with issues with your water heater installation such as having to re-install it, leaks, or having to spend money to replace it. The certified, experienced plumbing professionals at Putman & Son's Plumbing will do the job right the first time around, ensuring that you don't have to deal with costly repairs or mistakes that will end up being a major inconvenience in the future if they lead to water heater issues or leaks.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>Plumbers can contact the plumbers' water heater information line on 1300 883 019 (Monday to Friday, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm) for assistance. Water flow automatically ignites the water heater's burner, and your water is heated as it follows a serpentine path through the heating element.
