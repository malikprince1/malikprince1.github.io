Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use.

This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life.
