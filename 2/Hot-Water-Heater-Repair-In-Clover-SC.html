<p>Are you in doubt of the right Electric Tankless Water Heater to buy? We'll determine the right water heater sizing, and help you find the ideal balance of initial cost, equipment lifetime, and operating cost. If additional upgrades are required to create space for the new unit and bring the installation up to code, the overall installation cost will increase. Mitchell Heating DC's specialists can help evaluate and assess your property to know which water heater works best for your property.</p>
<p>Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use. The water passes through a heat exchanger, where heat from either natural gas or electrical heating elements is applied to it. The heat exchanger is activated by the movement of water, so the water is only heated when a tap turns on demanding hot water somewhere in the house. Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
