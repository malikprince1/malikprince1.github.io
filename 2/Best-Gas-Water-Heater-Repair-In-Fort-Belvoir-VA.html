<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Belvoir Virginia</h2>
<p>Water is dripping constantly from the rag that you have wrapped around the pin hole in the water pipe. Install an additional tankless water heater to ensure you can always meet demand. Once your water heater stops working, you should know what to do, whether to apply a DIY approach or to go on and call a plumber. When you open a faucet, the released hot water is replaced by incoming cold water, which is heated and stored again at a temperature controlled by one or more thermostats in the tank. Having hot water and heat for your home is a must have.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible. Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater. It is best to have a professional take care of these type of issues as there are electrical and water hazards involved in making these repairs. Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Fort Belvoir Virginia 22060</h3>
<p>Contact us today for professional water heater repair services in Des Moines. Pardee Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning can calculate that by helping you become knowledgeable about how much hot water you consume and the flow rate of various fixtures and appliances in your home. So if your temperature is set too high, the unit may be slowing the flow to give the water more time to reach the output temperature.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>
<p>High energy bills - An old water heater may be working harder than it needs to and, in turn, raising your energy bills unnecessarily. Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
<p>Condensing water tanks that run on natural gas have a special flue that captures wasted energy. Solar heating systems come with a large up-front cost ranging from $2,500 to $6,000, before counting the average savings of $1,200 from the tax credit. At Lighthouse Mechanical Heating and Cooling, we offer a complete line of high-quality tankless water heater models, along with tankless water heater installation, maintenance and repair services to support all your water heating needs.</p>
