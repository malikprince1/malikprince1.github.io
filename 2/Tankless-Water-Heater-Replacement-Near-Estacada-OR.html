When this happens, you can often hear rumbling or banging sounds coming from the water heater as it is heating up. This is a sign that the water heater is at the end of its useful life.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries.

Additionally, if you have a gas system, you will need to modify the gas lines feeding the heater and this can be very costly.

<p>Natural gas units are the least expensive choice and are powered from a city utility supply which costs an average of $200 per year. Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>
