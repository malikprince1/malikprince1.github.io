<h2>Water Heater Services Venice Florida</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services. We have provided outstanding plumbing services since 1980 and have plenty of experience with all types of water heaters. To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
<p>Our technicians are equipped and trained to solve even the toughest of water heater problems, and will work quickly and efficiently so that your water heater is up and working normally again. If you discover rusty water coming from your water heater and it only comes from the hot side piping in your home, this can be a sign that your water heater is rusting away on the inside and it may begin to leak soon.</p>
<p>The benefits to installing tankless water heaters are numerous, but it's important to choose the right tankless water heater for your needs. Don't be shy about asking a retailer why the tankless water heater is discounted. So, over the typical duration of a unit, it will be a lot more efficient than a conventional tank-based heater. Once the old heater is done draining disconnect the gas pipe at the union fitting.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated, via electrical resistance coils or natural gas. These kinds of tankless gas water heaters, like the Bosch 2400EO-NG natural gas outdoor water heater, helps eliminate the need for vents. Some of these issues can be addressed by installing a tankless water heater. For expert water heater repair in the Orange County area, look to your neighbors at Barker and Sons Plumbing & Rooter.</p>
