Rust is a common problem with water heaters and may require a complete hot water replacement.

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
