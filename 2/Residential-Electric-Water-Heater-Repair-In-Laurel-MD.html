<p>The water storage tank works in a very simple way; at the top of the tank are two feed pipes, one for cold water the other for the hot water. Whether gas or electric, tankless water heaters heat water only as it is needed and may save up to 70 percent on a yearly heating bill. The tankless water heater heats the water when it is required. These traditional heaters can be exhausted and take a long time to refill and reheat.</p>
<p>There are leaks at the base of the water heater tank. Use pipe that is rated for hot water such as copper or CPVC. Under no circumstances do working water heaters need to be replaced. They're efficient, durable and 80 percent smaller than conventional hot water tanks. This means a newer installation is nearly guaranteed to provide quicker, more efficient, and more effective hot water delivery. Calculate the maximum simultaneous demand for hot water in the house, and you'll know which system(s) should be installed and where it should be located.</p>
<p>Natural-gas water heaters typically use less energy and cost less to run (by about half) than electric water heaters, although you should note that gas models cost more at the time of purchase. We also provide emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When properly maintained, tankless water heaters often have a lifespan of at least 20 years (approximately twice that of conventional storage tanks).</p>

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>While tankless systems are more energy efficient and last longer, they are not able to provide hot water to multiple appliances at once. So this water heater was made in June 2005. If your water comes out of the faucet with a brown, yellow, or red tint to it, there could be corrosion occurring inside your water heater tank or in the pipes in your home.
