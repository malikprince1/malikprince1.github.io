<h3>Water Tank Repair Honea Path South Carolina 29654</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures.
