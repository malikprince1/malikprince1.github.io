<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater.

Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine.

One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
