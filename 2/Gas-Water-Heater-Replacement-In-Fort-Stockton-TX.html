<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Stockton Texas</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>

And this is technology used in these tankless heaters is modern and hi-tech, but they produce one disadvantage that while CO2 emissions are reduced, an acidic condensate is formed.

If there's rust in your water it could mean that your water heater it deteriorating - a serious concern for any homeowner. All too often, a standard water heater will run out of hot water when you need it the most.</p>

Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy.
