<h2>Water Heater Services Machesney Park Illinois</h2>
<p>A tankless gas hot water heater can be complicated when it comes to piping and venting requirements. In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken. When the water on the top of the tank is hot, the top element turns off and the lower one heats.</p>

<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat.
