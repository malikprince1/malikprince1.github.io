<p>When it comes to do it yourself projects around the house, you can save a bundle of money over having someone else do the work for you. Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life. Payback time was longer for a tankless unit that replaced an existing storage tank but more reasonable with new construction.</p>
