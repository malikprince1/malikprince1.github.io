Traditional heaters often require replacement at the first sign of failure.</p>
<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>
