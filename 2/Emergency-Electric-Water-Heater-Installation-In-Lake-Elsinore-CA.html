<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>Not enough hot water - If you have limited hot water before it runs out, your heating elements are not properly doing their job. Most water heaters in New Mexico use natural gas and this means you have to burn combustible fuel to heat your water.

<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>It takes a good amount of time for the tank to fill back up, turn on the burner, and heat the water. In a gas based tankless system, the gas heater is responsible for heating the water. If you answered no” to one or more of these questions, especially, question #1, you should probably hold off and stick with a tank-style heater. We can relocate your water heater if needed.
