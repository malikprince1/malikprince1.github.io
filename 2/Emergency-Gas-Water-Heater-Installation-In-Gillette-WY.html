Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install. That varies with the location and design of the unit, quality of installation, maintenance schedule and water quality.</p>

With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
