<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>

The best heaters are those that have the best amount of insulation built into them. Permits are required on most water heater installs and pricing varies by province, city and municipality. Wait a few minutes to see if the water heater burner ignites. Or if your water heater is slow to heat or runs out of hot water faster than it used to, you may be able to make a quick fix by replacing the heating element.</p>

Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
