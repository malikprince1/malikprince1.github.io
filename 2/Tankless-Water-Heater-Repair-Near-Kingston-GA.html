<h2>Water Heater Services Kingston Georgia</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use. Water Heater- Install what you are taking out if you have a 40 gallon and want to upgrade to a 50 gallon now is the time to do it. If you do have a 50 gallon I DO NOT recommend switching to anything lower than what you have.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Place the water heater in a drip pan made for this purpose if the equipment is located inside the home, and especially if it is in the attic. Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>

While is seems like common sense to tell you, make sure you turn off the circuit breakers if you will be installing any electrical connections.

After years of tankless water heater installs, we've found that some consumers have expectations, realistic or otherwise, that should be addressed before deciding to go tankless.</p>
<p>This is an area where tank-style water heaters have a significant advantage over tankless. Heater Cost - Can be 2-3 times more expensive than a tank water heater. We do our best to provide same-day services because we understand that disruptive plumbing issues can happen unexpectedly. There is no boiler or tank to keep the water hot, so it is heated as needed by your faucet or appliance. Most tankless water heaters require disconnect switches, which should be installed next to the water heater.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some new code requirements have changed since your w. heater was first installed. With a range between $400 and $900, the average homeowner can expect to pay $650 to have a new water heater installed professionally. The right size unit can provide endless hot water for up to two major applications at a time. Standard water heaters can potentially build upscale and rust inside the tank over time, but a tankless unit gives you cleaner and fresh hot water all the time.</p>
