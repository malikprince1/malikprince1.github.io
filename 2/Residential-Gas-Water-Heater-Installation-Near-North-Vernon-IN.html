<h2>Water Heater Services North Vernon Indiana</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>

The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine.

<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time.

One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
