<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating.

This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>

Improper water heater installation can lead to a fire, flood or possibly death.
