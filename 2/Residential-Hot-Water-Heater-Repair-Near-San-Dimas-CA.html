<h2>Water Heater Services San Dimas California</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>

Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air.

Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
