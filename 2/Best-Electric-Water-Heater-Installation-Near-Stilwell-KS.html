<p>How much will a new hot water heater cost you? The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

<p>To minimize the cost of hot water, reduce the temperature of your hot water heater from the standard 140 degrees F to 120 degrees F.

<p>Be careful to ensure that your water heater is convenient and safe in case of future servicing. Remember, with tankless, there is no preheated reservoir of water. Once you close the hot water tap, the unit senses that the flow of water has stopped and shuts off the heating element. Get up to 36 months to pay for your new water heater, subject to credit approval. Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>
