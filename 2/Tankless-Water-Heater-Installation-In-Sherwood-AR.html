I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000. Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future. Mallick Plumbing & Heating is the Service Contractor of Choice in Silver Spring, MD and throughout Montgomery County. Storage tank water heaters have lower initial cost by a significant margin.</p>

Most noises are caused by sediment that builds up in the water tank over the years—so if you're hearing a lot of bangs, creaks, knocks, or whines, it may be a sign that it's past time for flushing.</p>
