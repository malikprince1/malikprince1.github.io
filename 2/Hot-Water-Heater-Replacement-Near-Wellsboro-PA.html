<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>If you choose to install one tankless water heater for each water outlet, you can even save as much as 50 percent on energy cost.

The cost of heating water consumes almost 20 percent of your household budget, second only to what you spend on heating and cooling your home.</p>
