We carry out full-service water heater solutions, including repair, installation, and replacement. It may take a few hours before your water heater if fully heated.

With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer.

<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker.

<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>Some heater models come with an incorporated technology using which the water flow generates a pilot spark. This means that you will need a tankless heater for every water source.

This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we have an option that will match your needs and save energy. Age: As a rule, if your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to invest in a new water heater. As soon you turn off the water flow, the heater turns off.
