<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>

<p>Circuit breaker for an electric heater trips. Tankless water heaters are perfect for vacation and second homes that are not constantly occupied. Tankless water heaters also use gas to heat water; however, tankless systems heat water on demand instead of expending energy maintaining a full tank of hot water. The water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust. This kind of heater can deliver a nearly endless source of hot water, because it's always heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>Be careful to ensure that your water heater is convenient and safe in case of future servicing. Remember, with tankless, there is no preheated reservoir of water. Once you close the hot water tap, the unit senses that the flow of water has stopped and shuts off the heating element.
