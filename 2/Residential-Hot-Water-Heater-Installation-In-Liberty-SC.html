<h2>Water Heater Services Liberty South Carolina</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you.

Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>

If your home runs strictly on electricity, you have to carefully consider whether going tankless is really worth it.
