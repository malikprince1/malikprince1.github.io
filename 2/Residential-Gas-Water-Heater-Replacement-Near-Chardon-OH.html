Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>

The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>If you have water on the floor or on top of the unit (this is different from water leaking from a supply line above the unit), you'll probably need a new water heater.
