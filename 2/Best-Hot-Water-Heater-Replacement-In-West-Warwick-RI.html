<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>

As such, the most dangerous problem that could ever occur would be a serious leak with your water heater.

Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process). Always replace the dielectrics when installing a new water heater. Professional installation, which we recommend unless you are an experienced do-it-yourselfer, should cost about $150, part included.</p>
