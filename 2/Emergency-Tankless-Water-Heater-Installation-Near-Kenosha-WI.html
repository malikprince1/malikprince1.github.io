<h2>Water Heater Services Kenosha Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Having trouble with your hot water heater? With a gas tankless water heater, the burner may get clogged, resulting in hot spots that can burn the heat exchanger. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, you'll receive our 100 percent satisfaction guarantee and our lifetime craftsmanship warranty on all installations and repairs. Or, finally, you find your hot water heater closet's an impenetrable jungle of soldered copper, unions, flex connectors, and thermoplastic - all improvised by your adorable "handyman" over the years - call a HVAC contractor.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Removal - Most plumbers will charge between $250 and $500 to take the old water heater out and take it away for proper disposal. That's where an annual tank flush can come in handy, as it can remove these harmful sediments and ensure that your hot water tank is working at maximum efficiency. Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor. The issue here is that you have used a lot of energy to heat the entire tank's capacity yet you do not use all of it. This equates to wasted resources and it is certainly reflected on your energy bill.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Kenosha</h3>
<p>Tankless units eliminate the possibility of damage from flooding due to a ruptured tank. The answer to this question will depend on if your water heater has received regular maintenance or not. Most gas water heaters have a life span of eight to twelve years. TLC has several experienced plumbers who are trained to repair all makes and models of tankless water heaters. We make sure you can depend on whatever water heater you prefer to use in your home.</p>
<p>If you have ever done those things you might have found out that the T&P Valve wouldn't close properly after checking it and the water heater drain valve now leaks. We also install tankless systems. We will come in and replace any old piping, fix you up with corrosion-free drain plugs, and install the most energy-efficient models built today. Install the various fittings that come with the water heater. Estimate how much hot water your household uses during peak hours and look for a heater with a first hour rating (FHR) that meets your demand.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy , tankless water heaters can be between 8% and 50% more energy-efficient than tank-style water heaters, but the actual efficiency depends on the amount of hot water you use. If line voltage is present on a heating element, it must heat the water unless the element has failed. A water heater, especially an electric model, is a very simple device. Cleaner Water - A tankless unit gives you cleaner and fresh hot water all the time.</p>
<p>Gas-burning tankless water heaters should operate for 20 years or more, two or three times longer than tank-type heaters. The dip tube in your water heater makes sure the incoming cold water is distributed evenly throughout the tank. Rheem is the only manufacturer offering heating, cooling and water heating equipment, and EcoNet ® helps you manage them together—with Wink® compatability. 2.

<p>Either way, here are your primary water heating options. Note that the water heater should not share a circuit with another appliance—it draws too much power when heating. Tankless water heaters have been widely used in Europe and Japan for decades, and have become increasingly popular in North America as the Green Movement has gained traction. The direct vent tankless gas water heater is a bit different in that the combustion air comes directly from outside by way of a gas burner.</p>
<p>Almost double a traditional water heater's life. When deciding to buy a new hot water heater, there are a variety of factors to consider including your home's energy source, your lifestyle and the level of energy savings you wish to achieve. If you need help choosing the correct water heater for your home or business needs please contact us we can help you choose the perfect type and brand for your usage. For instance, if you have plumbing in a home shop, guest room or studio that's far from the main water heater, cold water standing in the pipes might delay the delivery of hot water for minutes, and waste a lot of water in the process.</p>

We provide a range of system types, brands, and sizes, including tank, tankless, hybrid, heat pump, and solar water heaters. With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>

Naturally, then, extending the life of your water heater and preventing any unexpected break downs is a priority.
