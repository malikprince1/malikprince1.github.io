<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Energy , tankless water heaters can be between 8% and 50% more energy-efficient than tank-style water heaters, but the actual efficiency depends on the amount of hot water you use.
