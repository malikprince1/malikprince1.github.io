Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs.

Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>
<p>How they work: Tank water heaters typically hold between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water (around 120 degrees Fahrenheit) in a storage tank. If the incoming water pressure is above 150 psi a pressure reducing valve must be installed upstream of the heater. Here are the biggest benefits of installing a tankless water heater in your home.
