Most water heaters in New Mexico use natural gas and this means you have to burn combustible fuel to heat your water. You can achieve even greater energy savings of 27%-50% if you install a demand water heater at each hot water outlet. A conventional water heater burns money, as it is constantly heating water you don't use.</p>

<p>Either way, here are your primary water heating options. Note that the water heater should not share a circuit with another appliance—it draws too much power when heating. Tankless water heaters have been widely used in Europe and Japan for decades, and have become increasingly popular in North America as the Green Movement has gained traction. The direct vent tankless gas water heater is a bit different in that the combustion air comes directly from outside by way of a gas burner.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

<p>Noritz has been an innovator in the water heating industry for over 60 years. This way the cold water can flow back to the heater through the cold water line. Mr. Electric service professionals are trained and experienced in installing tankless water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters come in three different types : non-condensing, condensing, non-condensing hybrid.

<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>

<p>A tankless water heater does not heat and re-heat the same water in the tank, saving you money. Noise - water heaters collect mineral deposits and sediment on the heating elements, just at the bottom of the tank. Enjoy having steady hot water again and call Trusted Plumbing.
