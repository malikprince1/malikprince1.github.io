<h2>Water Heater Services Fairfield Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Whenever you are ready to move forward with your tankless water heater project, your plumber or licensed installation professional should be well versed in the current status of rebates available and add that information to his recommendations.

When you find yourself with a hot water tank leaking water, it could lead to significant water damage to your home and belongings.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
<p>Electric units face even bigger changes. A tankless heater is not effective when more than two tasks are drawing from it. So it should be one at a time.
