<h2>Water Heater Services Littleton Colorado</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>

<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working.

<p>It's important to keep a separate store of water on hand just in case the public water pipes are damaged, broken or if your public water supply becomes contaminated. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. Instant water heaters have a lifespan of 15 to 18 years. There are numerous benefits to investing in professional water heater maintenance in Des Moines.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Since tankless heaters warm water on demand, they use much less energy. Professional advice and tips are provided in tankless water heater reviews posted on the pages of Web zines or "blogs". Heating your water can take up a great deal of energy. This saves you the burden of having to wait for a storage tank to fill up with hot water.

<p>Of course, the TP valve or pipe could still be warm if the water heater stopped working within the last 3 or 4 hours because the water inside would still be holding some heat. Tankless heaters are much more expensive than ordinary water heating systems. Regardless of the type of water heater that is in your home, it is an inevitability that you will experience some kind of issues with it. Usually, this is in the form of no hot water coming out of your faucets or shower.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gas tankless water heaters need you to have the right kind of gas - which could either be propane or natural gas - before you install any unit. Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
