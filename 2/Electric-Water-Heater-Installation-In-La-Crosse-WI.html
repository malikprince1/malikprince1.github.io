One of the biggest and least talked about drawbacks to tankless water heaters is that hard water destroys them. The beauty of investing in a tankless water heater is that it only uses energy when you are using it.

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
