It is a direct route to the exterior from the heater and works on the "hot air rises" principle which means that the hot combustion gases from the heater rise up, get captured by the draft hood and are lead to the exterior. The employees are excellent to work with: sales, repair, installation, follow-up.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
