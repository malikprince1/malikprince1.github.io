<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>Water heater installation and replacement is a job best left to the professional plumbers at Roto-Rooter. If the heater bottom develops a leak the heater cannot be repaired. What people are really asking when they say are tankless water heaters worth it is how do the energy savings over the lifetime of the heater compare to the initial cost. Both gas and electric tankless water heaters need electricity to run. Since tankless water heaters don't maintain a supply of water in a corroding tank, the water they distribute throughout your home is more pure and safer on your skin.</p>

If you desire a commercial tankless water heater for the cost-savings, we will work with you to find the best model for your application. Long recognized in Europe and Asia as a major energy- and space-saving solution, tankless water heaters have begun to make significant inroads in the North American market.</p>

No longer will you have to wait for hot water, wasting gallons at a time. If you combine that with a regular maintenance routine you can add years to your water heater's service life. List the phone numbers to preferred local handyman services, water damage restoration companies, pest control companies, electricians, roofing companies, plumbers, carpet cleaners, home improvement contractors, and so on. Provide pockets so that the tenant has a place to store contracts and receipts along with blank pages for writing down notes and estimates.</p>
