Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank. However, from time to time, something can happen which will require you to have to look for a quality water heater repair service.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P.
