<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater.

Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
