Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>I am sure that at least 50 percent of homes in the U.S. will at some time have to use their homeowners insurance to cover the costs of damages caused by busted water heaters.

Old water heaters aren't just inefficient, they are inconvenient. Fixed the tank less water heater.
