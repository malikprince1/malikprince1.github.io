Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank.

<p>A tankless water heater can place a virtually unlimited supply of hot water within your reach 24 hours a day while saving you time, energy, money, and space. First of all, it is important to understand the basic operation of a tankless water heater. New storage tank water heaters are required to operate more efficiently, and tankless (on-demand) water heaters are even more efficient than that.

That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
