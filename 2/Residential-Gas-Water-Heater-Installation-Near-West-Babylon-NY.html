When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Comfort - The hot water that you get from your tankless water heater is evenly paced and constantly the same temperature. The installation process for adding a tankless water heater on your property will primarily depend on the type of fuel you'll be using, your existing gas, water, and electricity setups, and the size of your system.
