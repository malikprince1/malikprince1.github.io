Rust is a common problem with water heaters and may require a complete hot water replacement. Anyone who is used to living with a 40 gallon water heater and would like to luxuriate in longer showers might think about purchasing the 50 gallon Rheem 22V50F1.</p>
<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower.

Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
