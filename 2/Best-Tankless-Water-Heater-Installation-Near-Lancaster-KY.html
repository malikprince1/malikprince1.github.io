<h2>Water Heater Services Lancaster Kentucky</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>

And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used.
