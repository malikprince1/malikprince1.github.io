A well-maintained water heater can last a long time, but eventually it's going to be time to replace it. Nowadays, the homeowner has a range of water heater types to choose from.</p>

You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>
<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
