You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>

<p>They conserve energy by only heating the amount of water needed at a given moment. Whenever we provide water heater replacement and installation services in Chattanooga, TN, you can expect nothing less than superior service. First, we help you size your tankless water heater based on the average simultaneous flow rate you require. But today's tankless water heater makes Ruud's invention seem hopelessly bulky and inefficient.</p>
<p>If the heating elements are good, the problem could be with the thermostats or cutoff switch. A traditional hot water heater typically holds 40-60 gallons of water that is collected in a tank and then continuously heated until it's needed. For your convenience we even offer extended warranty coverage on parts and labor on all water heaters installed by All Seasons Comfort Control. We can review the benefits of a storage tank vs. a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>

<p>Tankless water heater works rather differently from the conventional water heating system - it does not require a tank for hot water storage and it is more environment friendly as the system avoids standby energy consumption. Meeting increased hot water demands can be a challenge for traditional tank-style heaters. No matter the type, brand, or age of your water heater, our team can repair and maintain it. Our local technicians are licensed for gas, electric, and tankless water heater repair.</p>
