If these water heaters function in a cool environment (location), they'll work harder in the winter months, driving your gas or electric bills even higher during the cold winter.

Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are also the most eco-friendly, since they only heat water when it is needed. The cost of a new water heater depends largely on the type and size of the heater.
