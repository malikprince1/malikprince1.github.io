<h2>Water Heater Services Basking Ridge New Jersey</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>During the course of an average home occupancy, a resident is bound to face that moment where they need to replace a water heater. Traditional tank water heaters can become rusted or corroded over time. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently prepared. Importantly, all types of tankless water heaters use at least some electricity to operate the control systems. Run clean water through the heater for a few minutes, using the same pump arrangement as before.</p>
<p>Your Atlas plumbing expert will explain your tankless water heater options. If you do choose water heater replacement, we'll help you choose the best new water heater for your home. These heaters are ultra-efficient and offer an energy and money savings compared to the traditional water heater.

<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Basking Ridge</h3>
<p>Water is then heated by a copper heat exchanger fueled by gas or electricity, depending on your system. You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections. A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>Turn off the water, gas supply valves and power.
