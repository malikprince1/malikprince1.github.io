<h2>Water Heater Services Eastman Georgia</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>

For example, water heater tanks may accumulate scale and sediment over time, causing the tank to overheat or accelerating the corrosion of the sacrificial anode rod.</p>
