<h2>Water Heater Services Uncasville Connecticut</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters.

If you have a small drip or a leak coming out of your water heater, it's very important to get a plumber over right away.</p>
<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Uncasville</h3>
<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>

Moon Valley Plumbing offers a wide selection of water heater options, and we can also do water heater repair for whatever type of system you currently have.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>If your heater is approaching old age, replacement may be smarter than repair. They can supply endless hot water because they begin heating water as soon as a faucet is turned on. So, unlike tank heaters, users never have to wait for a massive tank of water to heat up between uses.

<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Uncasville CT</h3>
<p>Many homeowners, however, see benefits of a tankless water heater beyond energy savings. If you are looking for a 55+ gallon electric tank water heater, you will have to purchase a hybrid or heat pump, or a condensate tank if your fuel type is natural gas. Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>
<p>There are situations where your heater could break before it is old, however, and in these scenarios we might try repairing it. Repairing the heater is the best option because it costs less and is less of a hassle. If your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it replaced.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Uncasville Connecticut 06382</h3>
<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on. There is a heating element, or several heating elements, in the pipe and as the water flows over them, it gets heated up. These appliances are easy to install, provide great value, require less maintenance and offer every member of the family an unlimited supply of instant hot water.</p>
<p>These water heater systems do not occupy much space and rather easy to use. Just like other mechanical appliances in your home, water heaters also require periodic service and maintenance for smooth and uninterrupted functioning. Call us 24 hours a day 1-866-946-7842 to speak with a water heater expert- we will help diagnose an issue, check your water heater manufacturer's warranty status and schedule an appointment for repair services.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>That's where tankless, often called on-demand,” water heaters come in. You can get a low-end 50-gallon tank water heater for around $500 but a top-of-the-line Rinnai or Navien may cost around $1,500. Your water heater does not supply hot water constantly. With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Small apartments or limited use, such as in the case of having a single source for hot water access, may benefit from a single-point hot water tank. Tankless heaters last up to twenty-five years or more. Call (630) 577-9241 or (815) 609-1859 to discuss your water heater installation options. Even better, if your unit needs a boost to improve hot water production, our team can recommend and install attachments to increase efficiency.</p>
