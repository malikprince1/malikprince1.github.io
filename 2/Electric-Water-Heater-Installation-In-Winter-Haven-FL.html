It is a direct route to the exterior from the heater and works on the "hot air rises" principle which means that the hot combustion gases from the heater rise up, get captured by the draft hood and are lead to the exterior. The employees are excellent to work with: sales, repair, installation, follow-up.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Winter Haven Florida 33880</h3>
<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM. So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>
<p>If 10% of the population switched to energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, the result would be the equivalent of taking 1.3 million cars off the road. Stop waiting for hot water with a high-efficiency Navien tankless water heater from VIP Plumbing. A tankless water heater requires a higher voltage power supply. Step 9. Put the new water heater into the drain pan, making sure to clean the pan and inspect for holes in the pan first.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>
