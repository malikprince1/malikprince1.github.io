<p>Tankless water heaters are a relatively new entrant into the market, but they work quite well for most homeowners. This is true, but, like all man made things, at times, the heater might simply refuse to supply hot water. More Hot Water: Newer water heaters are able to provide you with more hot water. Check the literature for the brand heater you are considering and find the output in gallons per minute (GPM) at the temperature rise you need.</p>
<p>Many people are going towards getting tankless water heat so that they do not need to keep it maintained of another appliance. Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater. While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it. If you want to see what could potentially happen due to a failed T&P, just Google "water heater blast" and check out the video at the website of that name.</p>

The key feature is that the heater does not turn on until it senses that a hot water tap is being opened. They only heat the water as it's needed, unlike storage tank water heaters that require continuous maintenance of the temperature of the water in the tank.</p>
<p>There are situations where your heater could break before it is old, however, and in these scenarios we might try repairing it. Repairing the heater is the best option because it costs less and is less of a hassle. If your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it replaced.

<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Torrington Connecticut 06790</h3>
<p>A high-quality water heater installation can take a middle-of-the-road water heater and allow it to perform at its peak efficiency and longevity, while a poor quality water heater installation can cause even the best water heater to operate inefficiently and have a shorter-than-expected lifespan. No matter what issue you start to encounter with your tankless water heater, you must have licensed professionals handle any fixes.</p>
<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly. Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank. They have trouble with hard water: Hard water is bad for any water heater, but the effects of hard water will negatively affect a tankless system quicker as the sediment builds up in its lines.</p>
<p>Some homeowners find that local building codes have changed and that after their water heater is repaired, upgrades to the venting system, drain pan and other components are needed. Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>The Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve (TPR) is an essential water heater safety feature. Replacing your water heater with a new, more efficient one, could lower your high energy bills. Turn on a faucet, and there it is. When it runs out, it has to consume energy to bring new water up to temperature. While they're picking up the new one, tell them to slap some flexible pipe connections on your credit card, too, in case your new water heater's dimensions aren't the same as the old one's.</p>
<p>Condensing water tanks that run on natural gas have a special flue that captures wasted energy. Solar heating systems come with a large up-front cost ranging from $2,500 to $6,000, before counting the average savings of $1,200 from the tax credit. At Lighthouse Mechanical Heating and Cooling, we offer a complete line of high-quality tankless water heater models, along with tankless water heater installation, maintenance and repair services to support all your water heating needs.</p>
