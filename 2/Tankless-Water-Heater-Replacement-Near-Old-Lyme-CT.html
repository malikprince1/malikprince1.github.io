<h2>Water Heater Services Old Lyme Connecticut</h2>
<p>Repair guides and support for gas and electric hot water tanks, boilers and household heat exchangers. With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks. Keep in mind, however, that most conventional gas tank water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. We install new water heaters here in Natchitoches. A new energy-efficient water heater will help save you some money in energy costs each month.</p>

Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters cannot be repaired or it makes more sense to replace them after they have exceeded their expected service life.

A standard water heater has to keep a constant supply of heat to the water inside the tank in order to have it at the right temperature when you need to take a hot shower or wash the dishes.</p>
<p>Electric tank-type heaters utilize electrical-resistance heating elements located within the hot water storage tank to heat up the water within the tank. There is no need for a storage tank nor is there any energy wasted on heat loss with the tankless heating systems.

The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
