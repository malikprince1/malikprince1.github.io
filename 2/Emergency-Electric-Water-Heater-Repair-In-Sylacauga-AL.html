A gas water heater, if installed inside the house, will need to have a gas pipe run to its heating system to fuel the burners that are used to heat up the passing water.</p>

<p>A backup heating element is in the tank, so you'll have plenty of hot water, no matter what the weather. Tankless water heaters can also be used as a booster for dishwashers, washing machines, and as a backup for solar or wood-fired domestic systems. However, once they run out of water, users must wait for a new tank to reheat. If you're worried about installation costs, then you might want to consider electric tankless water heaters.</p>
