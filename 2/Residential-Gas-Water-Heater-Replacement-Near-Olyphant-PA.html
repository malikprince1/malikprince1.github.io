<h2>Water Heater Services Olyphant Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Olyphant</h3>
<p>When shopping for your next water heater, your fuel source will be the first variable to consider when sorting through options. Many times, the handyman of the family will see a new hot water heater or a tankless hot water heater in the household supply stores. A huge puddle of water all over your basement floor and it is coming from the bottom of the water heater. Keep the drain valve in the front as best as you can to easily drain out water later on in the water heater's life.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>

If you choose to proceed with a new water heater installation, we offer financing options to ease the upfront cost burden.

If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on.
