<h2>Water Heater Services Woodbridge Connecticut</h2>
<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters.

Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
