Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>
<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase.

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
