<p>Let us show you how our energy-efficient water heaters can decrease your costs while maximizing your satisfaction. Our team is fast, reliable, and local—plumber” is in our name, and plumbing is all we do. When you're facing an issue with your water heater or you're ready to upgrade, there's no group of professionals better equipped to help. Disconnect the wires leading to the heating unit, which may be held in place with screws.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>If a gas line has to be added or relocated, then a plumbing permit may be required for the modifications or changes; note that just one permit may cover both the water heater and plumbing modifications. Persistent noises: Sometimes the tank makes noises because the heating element is burning out. Since PSE&G is not a Licensed Master Plumber, we use authorized licensed installers to provide the optional WorryFree Water Heater Replacement Service.</p>
<p>If you are sure you have power, the problem is either your heating elements or thermostats. We want you to feel comfortable with us and confident you'll receive great service and excellent value for all your plumbing, heating and air conditioning needs. A functioning hot water heater is necessary for things like showers, dishes, and laundry. Second: tankless water heaters use a lot less energy than storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Depending on the service load of your home, you may need an electrician to install a larger breaker to provide you with enough power. Most tank-style water heaters won't live past 20 years. Press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element (one probe to each screw). Energy efficiency of your water heater can be improved through its correct installation and maintenance. A bonus: Without all that gunk inside, your water heater will operate more efficiently, saving you money.</p>
