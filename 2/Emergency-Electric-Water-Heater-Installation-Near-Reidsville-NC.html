<h2>Water Heater Services Reidsville North Carolina</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>3. If you are not getting the same hot water as you used to, then you probably need a new heater or to at least have it checked. Like our other services, your new water heater will be backed by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. There are several key operational differences between tankless and conventional heaters. When you're enjoying quality family time, the last thing you need is a plumbing emergency.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Reidsville</h3>
<p>If the electronic ignition system breaks, the water heater won't come on and you'll end up with no hot water at all. We'll get there quickly and fix that water heater fast. However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>Even if your family uses closer to 80 gallons of hot water daily, you can still enjoy 8% to 14% energy savings. Generally your first call for a balky water heater will be to a plumber, but if the plumber finds an electrical issue, you may need to call in a licensed electrician. Maintenance is the best way to make sure your water heater is in good condition, water heater maintenance isn't always something we think about doing.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater. To prevent injury, consider installing thermostatic mixing valves. When your shopping for tankless water heaters, the key metric you want to look at is flow rate.</p>
<p>It's measured in Gallons Per Minute or GPM, the higher the GPG, the more water can be heated at the same time. In a large home, or if you have a big family and heavy water usage, you may need to install two or more tankless models. The main factor is the cost of the water heater itself. If you run a business whose core operations depend on providing the customers with hot water as part of the experience, going tankless is a necessity that directly connects to the bottom line.</p>
<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Reidsville NC</h3>
<p>When it's time for a replacement, our service techs can install an energy-efficient water heater that meets your home's hot water demands. A licensed plumbing professional will ensure that your water heater is permitted and up to code upon installation. Drain and disconnect the old water heater. Thankfully, most water heaters give plenty of warnings that things aren't right, and when you notice them, it's time to call in a water heater repair company before it's too late.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>A leaking water heater can't be ignored, and you may want to call us for emergency service to minimize the damage. Our Buyers Guide can help you select a new water heater, and if you decide to install the tank yourself, you will need to remove your old water heater and dispose of it properly. If you aren't sure if your water heater can be repaired, we can help. Water heaters that are not well-maintained will succumb to wear-and-tear more quickly.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Reidsville North Carolina 27320</h3>
<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>Because a direct vent water heater has fewer moving parts in it with fewer things to go wrong, it will carry either a 6-, 9- or 12-year warranty, whereas a powered vent water heater will typically cap out at a 6-year warranty. For those who have already bought the product, tankless water heater reviews can help in locating dealers regarding service details and provide directions in case repairs are needed.</p>
<p>While conventional tanks can last for 10 to 12 years, tankless water heaters typically last for 20 years or more. Most tank heaters are expected to last 8-10 years. In Singapore, there are many plumbing services companies that offer water heater installation and repair services, however, their expertise may vary. Once our plumbers determine the fuel source in your home, they can start narrowing down the water heater selection.</p>
<p>I am sure that at least 50 percent of homes in the U.S. will at some time have to use their homeowners insurance to cover the costs of damages caused by busted water heaters. If this is the case then try to find the place which your pipe or tankless heater is frozen and thaw as soon as possible to prevent the pipe from bursting. The garage (free standing or attached) is one of those not-preferable locations for the water heater installation, but sometimes it is the only one.</p>
<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
