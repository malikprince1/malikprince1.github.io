Tip: Routine upkeep on your water heater is a good idea.</p>

As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>Water heater service is often overlooked, but your water heater is one of the most important pieces of technology in your home. If you're noticing your system is struggling to operate, hot water heater repair is needed.

If your household's hot water consumption is 41 gallons and below, you can save as much as 34 percent in energy usage.</p>
<p>Sensors usually tell the heating unit when a tap in the house is turned on. The water that passes through the pipe that passes through the heating unit is then heated to a specific temperature. Keep in mind, when it comes to water heater repairs, this is not the time to do it yourself.

<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time. The only way to know if your current hot w. heater is collecting minerals and deposits is to call a qualified plumber and have them come out and inspect your w. heater.</p>

Whether you're just moving into your first home or you've been in the same place for years, it's important to have your hot water heater inspected and maintained.</p>
<p>For instance, for a home with two stories and a basement, the worst place to install the heater is in the basement. However if you find that you have no hot water with an electric tank it would be a good idea to check your breaker to see if the breaker has tripped. A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>
