<h2>Water Heater Services Kyle Texas</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

Can help you move into the future with a tankless water heater installation.</p>
<p>Check the surrounding pipes for leaks that could damage the water heater. After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels. Even when well-maintained, a tank-style heater will only last up to about 15 years, which means you'll have to spend even more replacing it. One of the most important, but also most unnoticed, appliances in your home is your water heater.</p>

Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>On-demand water heaters don't require repairs as often as conventional water heaters, but they do need regular service. Tankless water heaters are sized according to its maximum temperature rise possible at a given flow rate. The two pipes coming out of the top of every water heater tank are the supply and delivery pipes ; one is the cold-water inlet pipe and the other is the hot-water outlet pipe The cold-water inlet pipe carries cold water from your home's water supply into the tank where it comes out of the dip tube , filling the tank with water to be heated.</p>
