We offer fast, same day service and will send a trained professional to your home or business and do our best to ensure that you have hot water again as quickly as possible. Traditional tank water heaters are sold clearly marked with their capacity in gallons on a label on the tank. Propane costs an average of $350 per year to run a heater.</p>
<p>An electric whole house tankless hot water heater can be shipped to your home, and be operational the same day. To protect your investment, we choose top-rated residential and commercial water heaters that include long-term factory warranties. Water heating is the second largest energy expense in your home. A water heater is basically a household appliance that consists of a gas or electric heating unit under a tank in which water is heated and stored.</p>
<p>The good thing is that they can be replaced; however, this is another instance where a professional plumbing tech should look the heater over to see if there aren't any other glaring issues. As such, the most dangerous problem that could ever occur would be a serious leak with your water heater. If you closed the hot water faucet, you should open it again, as well as the T&P valve This will help the water drain faster by allowing air into the tank.</p>
<p>The most popular type of tankless water heater is a natural gas-powered model. Once the gas meter's capacity is confirmed, determine whether the gas line is also adequately sized to supply enough gas to the water heater. Repairing your commercial water heater couldn't be any easier. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>

We carry a variety of the conventional water heaters to meet every need. This model is also referred to as a demand-type” or instant” water heater, and provides hot water by heating up cold water as it passes through the unit, as opposed to storing it in a tank like a traditional unit would.</p>

<p>Please contact a professional to fix and maintain your hot water heater. Turn off the water inlet and outlet valves on the water heater. When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>
<p>Keep your water heater set to 120 degrees F as higher temperatures can increase sediment buildup in the tank. The next thing that you should consider if you are asking the question of when do you need a new water heater is the age of the system that you have in your home. Traditional tank water heaters can run on gas or electricity. Here at The Hot Water Company, we are taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and can actually serve our great customers without coming in contact with them at all, as most water heaters are located outside or in the garage.</p>
<p>If your water heater does not have a flue, then it is an electric water heater with a 240-volt supply (see the images in Figure 1 ).
