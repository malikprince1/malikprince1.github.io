Each hot water heater comes with a digital control pad that allows you to control the water temperature for various water outlets in your home or business. There are many different types of water heaters on the market.</p>

<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>A recirculating pump will push the cold water in your pipes back to the water heater, saving water and making sure you have hot water as soon as you turn on the tap. These heaters are versatile enough to be used for a variety of purposes including bathrooms and hot tubs, for appliances like dishwashers and washing machines, and as a booster for solar water heaters. If your current system is outdated, there will be other costs such as replacing the ductwork or plumbing.</p>
<p>They are called tankless as they heat up water only during the times you turn on your hot water tap. If your water heater is nearing the end of its useful life and you're thinking of replacing it before disaster strikes, you'll be happy to know that you have better choices, thanks to recent federal regulations that require water heaters to be more energy-efficient. Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>

We carry a variety of the conventional water heaters to meet every need. This model is also referred to as a demand-type” or instant” water heater, and provides hot water by heating up cold water as it passes through the unit, as opposed to storing it in a tank like a traditional unit would.</p>

Traditional water heaters cost less than tankless or heat pump water heaters - it's one reason why they're the most popular choice among Atlanta homeowners.

Water heaters will experience several problems throughout their service life because of normal wear and tear - a process that happens as the water heater ages, but can be prevented with regular inspections and maintenance.</p>

<p>The Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve (TPR) is an essential water heater safety feature. Replacing your water heater with a new, more efficient one, could lower your high energy bills. Turn on a faucet, and there it is. When it runs out, it has to consume energy to bring new water up to temperature. While they're picking up the new one, tell them to slap some flexible pipe connections on your credit card, too, in case your new water heater's dimensions aren't the same as the old one's.</p>
<p>Water heater experts recommend that homeowners flush the sediment from their water tanks once or twice a year, depending on the quality of water in their area. If a replacement is needed, our licensed plumbers will discuss the pros and cons of different types of water heaters. Cost To Use - More expensive to use by as much as 24% to 34% because the 23 to 56 or more gallons of water must be kept hot night and day.</p>
