The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>

Call Design Air for professional water heater installation services. First, heat rises and you are using a gas-powered unit, so if you live in a very hot climate, this could be dangerous.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are compact heating units that provide hot water as it is needed and do not store hot water like traditional tank-type water heaters.
