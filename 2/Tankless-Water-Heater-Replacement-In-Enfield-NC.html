<h2>Water Heater Services Enfield North Carolina</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>

No storage or holding tank means that tankless water heaters have a life span twice as long as traditional systems because the risk of rust and corrosion is significantly lower.</p>
<p>Traditional tanked storage water heaters are the most commonly found type of water heaters in homes today. If you have a current water heater that needs to be removed, or if your home needs electrical or structural updates to hold the new unit, these will add on to your final cost.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Enfield North Carolina 27823</h3>
<p>It's important to keep a separate store of water on hand just in case the public water pipes are damaged, broken or if your public water supply becomes contaminated. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. Instant water heaters have a lifespan of 15 to 18 years. There are numerous benefits to investing in professional water heater maintenance in Des Moines.</p>
<p>8. A good indicator for both electric and gas heaters is the sacrificial anode rod. Your water heater is under constant stress to deliver enough hot water for your family. There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be. A water leak could be the cause as to why the hot water doesn't reach the showerhead and faucets. A cold climate can push tankless heaters right up to the limits of their capabilities.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place.

Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>You will save a substantial amount of money using gas over electricity as the latter cost more on a per unit basis to operate. Most tankless water heaters are designed for a variety of inlet water temperatures evaluated. Daily hot showers and warm water to wash our dishes, clothes, and perform so many other ordinary tasks is made possible by a water heater that's out of sight and out of mind.
