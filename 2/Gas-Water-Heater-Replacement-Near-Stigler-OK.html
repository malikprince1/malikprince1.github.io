<h2>Water Heater Services Stigler Oklahoma</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters: They're All About Saving Space and Having the Luxury of Unlimited Hot Water. It's at times like these that you need to have a reliable emergency plumber like Swick Home Services on speed dial. Older models were supplied with an LPG water heater, normally fitted in a compartment somewhere. Tankless water heaters cost more than traditional tank water heaters; typically about twice the price for the unit alone, depending on what flow rate is needed.</p>
<p>If you want your water heater to be replaced with a Mike Diamond Plumbing water heater we are happy to still keep your planned appointment. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you think that your hot water heater is failing, or you just purchased a home and aren't sure about the condition of your heater, it's important to work with a water heater inspection company to evaluate your system.</p>
