<p>Please follow all plumbing and electrical codes when sourcing and installing parts for your new water heater. Whether you're running out of hot water on a daily basis, struggling with high energy costs, or worried about deterioration, you may be looking for a change. The actual zone in which the water heater is installed doesn't matter. Tankless water heaters are also supposed to be drained and the filters cleaned every month.</p>
<p>Water heaters that are not installed correctly can leak, causing water and mold damage. If water does take a long time to get to a faucet, the real solution is to add a circulation system to your water's heat source. However, if you're in the market for a water heater upgrade or new installation, you may want to consider tankless water heaters.

<p>The following guide explains how to install an electric tankless water heater step by step. These units heat faster and are more economical than standard electric models. Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>

As long as these needs are met, it is convenient for tankless water heating to take place in the bathroom. These water heaters operate in tandem with your home heating system and are often seen in conjunction with boilers. There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>
