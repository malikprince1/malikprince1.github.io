<h2>Water Heater Services Lawrenceburg Indiana</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants.

Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections.
