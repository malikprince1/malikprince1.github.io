A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>
<p>On more recent water heaters, the combustion chamber may be sealed. This matters since it would require more power to heat colder water. There can be huge variances in what different gas fitters charge for hot water system installation cost. If this happens, you should reduce the demand for hot water by limiting simultaneous applications, and you may want to consider resetting your unit. Traditional tank water heaters take up valuable space in a basement, attic or closet—space you could use.</p>

<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Small apartments or limited use, such as in the case of having a single source for hot water access, may benefit from a single-point hot water tank. Tankless heaters last up to twenty-five years or more. Call (630) 577-9241 or (815) 609-1859 to discuss your water heater installation options. Even better, if your unit needs a boost to improve hot water production, our team can recommend and install attachments to increase efficiency.</p>
