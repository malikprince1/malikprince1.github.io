<h2>Water Heater Services Cullowhee North Carolina</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>When the hot water tap is activated, cold water travels through a pipe into the tankless unit, where either a gas or electric element delivers heat. When it comes to tankless water heaters there really is nothing we can't do and do really well. Removing your current water heater cost anywhere from $100 to $500. The most common issues that occur in regards to tankless water heaters are system overload, mineral buildup, flame failure, or an exhaust blockage.</p>

<p>Tankless: Tankless water heaters tend to cost more up front than storage tank models. Hot water heaters come in all shapes and sizes, some fueled by natural gas or oil, some by electricity or propane. If these tanks are replaced with tankless hot water heaters, newfound space can be converted into another resident amenity, such as on-site storage or laundry, both of which can bring in extra revenue. Most heaters are not sold with these jackets in place so a lot of heat can be lost through the tanks body.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Cullowhee North Carolina 28723</h3>
<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>Please contact a professional to fix and maintain your hot water heater. Turn off the water inlet and outlet valves on the water heater. When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models. When you need hot water, the tankless water heater draws cold water into the heater, circulates it around a heat exchanger, and sends it back out into your home's piping.</p>
<p>Instead, the water is heated when it passes through the system, which may be fuelled by gas or electricity. Typical home water heaters are the large storage types that take up a significant amount of room in the garage or basement. After a while fixing a leak-prone water heater can become costly.

<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
