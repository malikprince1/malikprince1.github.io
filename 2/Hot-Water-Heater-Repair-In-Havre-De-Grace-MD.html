<p>Below are some good reasons why you should consider a tankless hot water heater for your new or pre-existing home, office, workshop, or cabin project. There are other advantages to having a tankless water heater and that you will not have to worry about your young ones going down and playing with the facet that is on the outside of the water heater and taking a chance on getting burnt in the end with it. Plus you are not going to need to make sure that there is not unused hot water in your tankless water heater that would end up running the pipes in the long run.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube.
