<p>This system is also known as "demand water heaters" as they provide hot water only when needed. But there is one caveat: Because a tankless water heater heats the water real-time as the water moves through the unit, it can only heat a given amount of water at one time. Most noises are caused by sediment that builds up in the water tank over the years—so if you're hearing a lot of bangs, creaks, knocks, or whines, it may be a sign that it's past time for flushing.</p>

The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
