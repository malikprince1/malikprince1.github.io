We will review the benefits of tankless water heaters , installation tips for a tankless water heater in a bathroom, and why this might be a great upgrade for your Michigan home. When this happens, you can often hear rumbling or banging sounds coming from the water heater as it is heating up. This is a sign that the water heater is at the end of its useful life.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home.

New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once.

A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>
