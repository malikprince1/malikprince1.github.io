<h2>Water Heater Services Joliet Illinois</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues. With a Rinnai® tankless water heater you'll enjoy the total confidence that comes with more than 30 years of innovation, support and integrity. A tankless water heater not only offer on-demand hot water, but this type of water heater comes in both electric and gas options.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Joliet Illinois 60435</h3>
<p>Whether we simply need to replace a broken part, remove excess sediment, repair the heating element, or do something else entirely, we'll make safety our priority. You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting. Answers to this issue are turning up the heat dial on the water heater, insulating the hot water pipes, moving the water heater, installing a second water heater or adding a recirculating pump system.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>They are smaller than conventional storage heaters, are wall mounted and do not take up floor space. Common problems you can expect to experience include low gas pressure, a low heating capacity, or rusty-looking water. Make sure when you call a plumber you call a licensed plumber that is experienced in repairing tankless water heaters. Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater installation codes.</p>
<p>Tightening the heating element mounting bolt - Make sure not to overtighten this, though. Installing a whole-house water softener can mitigate calcium buildup, lengthening the life of your water heater. We offer both conventional and tankless water heater options, rebates and eco-friendly discounts. But, as the concept of heating water on demand become more popular, and because tankless water heaters are more energy efficient, homebuilders began installing them.</p>
<p>If you do opt for a whole house tankless heater then get yourself a hot water demand system. If your water heater has an EF of at least 0.82, you can qualify for federal tax credit. Incorrect installations can shave years off your water heater, can significantly reduce its performance, and can expose you to unsafe conditions. These small systems can be installed easily and provide you with pinpoint temperature accuracy for all your water heating needs.</p>
