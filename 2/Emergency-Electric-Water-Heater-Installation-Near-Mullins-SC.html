<p>The water storage tank works in a very simple way; at the top of the tank are two feed pipes, one for cold water the other for the hot water. Whether gas or electric, tankless water heaters heat water only as it is needed and may save up to 70 percent on a yearly heating bill. The tankless water heater heats the water when it is required.
