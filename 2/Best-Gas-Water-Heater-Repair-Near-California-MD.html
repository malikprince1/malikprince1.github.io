<h2>Water Heater Services California Maryland</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>

<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
