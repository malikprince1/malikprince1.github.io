A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>
