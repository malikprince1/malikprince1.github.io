And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>

Whether you're running out of hot water on a daily basis, struggling with high energy costs, or worried about deterioration, you may be looking for a change. The actual zone in which the water heater is installed doesn't matter. Tankless water heaters are also supposed to be drained and the filters cleaned every month.</p>
<p>In Denver, any plumber who is licensed by the Colorado Plumbing Board and the City and County of Denver can handle almost all water heater problems. As the water heats, pressure builds inside the tank. The first tankless water heaters were only about two feet by three feet and bumped out from the wall about 12 or more inches. This means your water heater won't have to work as hard to heat your home's water, so an electrical model will likely work fine for most Atlanta homes.</p>
<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.
