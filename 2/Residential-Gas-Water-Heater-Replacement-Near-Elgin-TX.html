<h2>Water Heater Services Elgin Texas</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use.

If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>
