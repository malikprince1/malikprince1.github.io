<h2>Water Heater Services Palmetto Georgia</h2>
<p>When you need to repair your water heater and you have forgotten where you put your warranty or manual, it helps to have some tips to guide you along the way. You don't want to have to deal with issues with your water heater installation such as having to re-install it, leaks, or having to spend money to replace it.

They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>The more people and the more simultaneous usage possibilities, the greater the GPM needs to be. One solution is to install multiple tankless units to meet the demands of a large household, but that can become very expensive. A typical tankless water heater can produce between 7 and 15 litres of hot water per minute.
