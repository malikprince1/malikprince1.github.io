Electric water heaters use electricity to heat water.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gas tankless water heaters need you to have the right kind of gas - which could either be propane or natural gas - before you install any unit. Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
