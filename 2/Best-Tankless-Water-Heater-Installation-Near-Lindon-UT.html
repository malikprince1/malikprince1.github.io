<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections.
