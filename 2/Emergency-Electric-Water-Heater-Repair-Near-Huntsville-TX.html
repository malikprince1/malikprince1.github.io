<h2>Water Heater Services Huntsville Texas</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Water Heaters Only, Inc provides water heater service in San Jose and the surrounding and the surrounding communities including: Santa Clara, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Morgan Hill and Monte Serreno. Tankless water heaters can be powered by both gas and electricity. If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas shutoff valve in the supply line, too, before disconnecting it. If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>
<p>Cost effective - A tankless water heater can cut energy costs from heating water by as much as 35% or more each year, which really adds up.

Energy-efficiency: Tankless water heaters reduce your carbon footprint by only using energy when needed to flash heat water.</p>
<p>Although tankless water heaters cost a little more to install initially than regular tank systems , you'll find you'll begin to save in the long term. We have been so long in this business that we have witnessed the introduction of the first tankless water heater models in Dallas. Your actual savings depend on the type, size and energy efficiency rating of the hot water system you currently own. Accelerated Damage — the extra time that a tank spends heating water can cause the metal to turn brittle, which accelerates the likelihood of crack formation.</p>
<p>This saves you more on energy costs. Energy efficiency was Excellent and annual operating costs were low, just $240. Tankless water heaters also typically have a longer warranty. Prior to buying the hot & electric heaters you can even go through the online reviews. Something else to think about is if you can't upgrade to a larger conventional water heater because it may not fit. If you have limited space in your utility room or you like saving money on the energy bill and having consistent hot water, you need a tankless water heater installation estimate from AC Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
