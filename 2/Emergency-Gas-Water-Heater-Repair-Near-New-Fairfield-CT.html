<h2>Water Heater Services New Fairfield Connecticut</h2>
<p>When it comes to water heaters, there is strong disagreement as to which one type of electric hot water heater is better: whether gas hot water heater or the electric hot water heater. Furthermore, some types of water heater damage cannot be repaired and always require system replacement, regardless of the age of your water heater. Installation for these gas pipes require professionals who know the risks and safety measures needed to ensure that there are no leakages that can cause fires and accidents. This hybrid system makes use of your current plumbing and is a great choice for restaurants or other locations where there is a high demand for hot water.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection.

If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>

It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
