With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
<p>Turn Off On Its Own: If there issues within the tankless water heater than it can cause it to turn off on its own. Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone. In most cases, the water heater always gives way to the furnace thereby depriving you of hot water supply. A cracked or corroded storage tank is also a sign you need to replace your entire unit.</p>
<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.

There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be.
