<h2>Water Heater Services East Haven Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>Cleaner water - A tankless unit provides cleaner water too. Energy conservation is a great feature of on-demand tankless water heaters, but it's not the only great feature.

<p>Removal - Most plumbers will charge between $250 and $500 to take the old water heater out and take it away for proper disposal.

Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor. The issue here is that you have used a lot of energy to heat the entire tank's capacity yet you do not use all of it. This equates to wasted resources and it is certainly reflected on your energy bill.</p>

Most noises are caused by sediment that builds up in the water tank over the years—so if you're hearing a lot of bangs, creaks, knocks, or whines, it may be a sign that it's past time for flushing.</p>
