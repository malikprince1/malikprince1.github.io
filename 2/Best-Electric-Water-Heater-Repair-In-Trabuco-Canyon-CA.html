We can help you find the best water heater brand and then install it quickly and efficiently. But if a heater's Btu output can't keep up with demand, it will cut back the flow, or, worse case, deliver lukewarm water.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

Similarly, in case you find a pool of water on the floor where your electric water heater is installed, you should urgently call a plumber, as it again is a crisis situation.

<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>A water heater is an item that most homeowners don't think about daily. We'll answer all your questions and provide the information you need to decide if a tankless heater fits your needs. The major difference between the two types is that the flow controlled type works only with cold water while the thermostatic type can function with hot or cold water. Tankless water heaters heat water directly without the use of a storage tank.</p>

To prevent serious health issues from interior air contamination, gas-powered tankless water heaters require special venting to remove the hot carbon monoxide exhaust fumes and expel them to the outside air. It's usually placed in your basement, by furnace or water heater, or underneath your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>
<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
