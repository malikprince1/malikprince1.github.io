<h2>Water Heater Services Seymour Connecticut</h2>

Doctor Fix it installs all makes and models of water heaters, and can also educate you about the benefits of Tankless Water Heaters as another option for endless hot water.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system.

<p>It is also a good idea to check the anode when you flush the heater, if you make this a routine you will be able to replace the anode before it is completely gone. Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>Disconnect the electrical wires on the top of the water heater. What's more, since their introduction in the United States in the 1990s, tankless heaters have become increasingly sophisticated, with features like built-in recirculating pumps (for instant” hot water), and wireless connectivity that tells you via smartphone exactly when a unit needs maintenance. In that scenario the person is left waiting for the tank of water to become heated to the set temperature.</p>
