<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

Our plumbers have the experience and training to install, maintain, and service gas, electric, and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to replace a water heater is to replace like for like.

<p>If you have water on the floor or on top of the unit (this is different from water leaking from a supply line above the unit), you'll probably need a new water heater.

<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>

If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation. Also, know it's purpose because if it will only be running a kitchen sink, you can get away with a model that uses less energy and save a good deal of money.</p>
<p>By installing it as a point of use water heater, you will get instant hot water as soon as you turn on the faucet.
