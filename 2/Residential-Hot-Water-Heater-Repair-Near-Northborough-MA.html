<h2>Water Heater Services Northborough Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters also known as Instant hot water heaters, do not store water. You may want to have another gas shutoff valve installed just prior to the unit being installed. If your plumbing or electrical system requires upgrading to permit the use of a tankless heater it can be extremely expensive. Water heaters are not simple appliances. This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it. It's pretty clear that this will cause an increase in water being run down the drain, costing the home owner money, wasting one of our most precious resources.</p>

<p>Like all other plumbing systems in your home, regular maintenance can ensure your home's hot water heater continues to perform at its very best. Whenever removing electric elements on an electric water heater, be sure that the electricity is turned off. Tankless units last about 5-10 years longer than conventional units. Even if you are replacing your water heater with a conventional one, the installation process is not as simple as it might seem.</p>
