So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

Whether you're just moving into your first home or you've been in the same place for years, it's important to have your hot water heater inspected and maintained.</p>

<p>This is an important and a safety component of a hot water heater tank. The conventional heater and storage tank that is installed mostly in garages has undergone some very good improvements that make them much more efficient with a faster recovery period and with less gas or electricity usage. It's just that some water heaters come with a filter screen at the cold water inlet that requires cleaning every once in a while.</p>
<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork. Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
