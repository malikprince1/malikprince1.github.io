<h2>Water Heater Services Aptos California</h2>
<p>Are you struggling with a broken water heater? Energy efficiency is a good starting point but there are other things we need to look at. Assuming that you are going to go with the more efficient tankless heater the most important pieces of information you need are the climate zone you live in, how many gallons of hot water you expect to use during the most demanding part of the day and how much you would pay for utilities, if you have a choice.</p>
<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Our technicians are experienced enough to handle all brands and models of water heaters such as Racold, Venus, etc. Relying on your plumber's hot water heater system replacement recommendation may not be the best choice for you or your hot water system installation. If your water heater was plumbed with copper piping, you may need to cut the pipes. If you plan on holding onto the property for some time, a tankless water heater might be a good option.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Aptos</h3>
<p>Even with federal and local rebates, what you'll spend to buy and install a solar system can mean waiting 10 to 30 years to recover your investment costs, although solar panels and equipment are becoming less costly all the time. The liquid used in this system, often a form of antifreeze will be cycled through solar panels and then down to the hot water tank. Brass vs. plastic drain valves: These are situated near the base of the water heater for a garden hose that drains the heater.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>
<p>If you have a water heater with a re-circulation pump, we can check that the pump is working correctly and re-install the existing pump or replace the re-circulation pump if needed during your water heater replacement. If you depend on electricity to heat your water, you have another choice that's better than a conventional tank or a tankless water heater. Give us a call at 815-873-6003 or contact us online today to discuss your water heater concerns.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>
