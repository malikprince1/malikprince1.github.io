<h2>Water Heater Services Cheyenne Wyoming</h2>
<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready. Water heaters are fired by gas or electricity. Water leaks and gas leaks can be fixed by tightening the connections or soldering the pipes. Tankless water heaters also have limited output. Whether you're looking for a quick repair or a comprehensive installation, Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.</p>

Our water heater repair and water heater installation service technicians make the process of having work done on your water heater easy for you. Read on to find out why you should think about installing one of these heaters in your home.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>

<p>The two most important areas you have to focus on when installing a tankless water heater are making sure you have the right size fittings and that you have a proper ventilation system set up for the unit.

A basic solar water heater system can cost $1,000-$4,000 to install, minus possible tax credits of up to 30% off the cost.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>That's the number that tells you how much hot water the heater can deliver over a set period of time. By combining these costs over a pre-determined period of time, we are able to understand and compare the total cost of ownership. If the TP valve or outlet pipe is cold, the water heater hasn't been working for several hours. Prices range from about $170 for small gas-fired units to more than $2,000 for high-output heaters that can supply two showers at the same time; $1,000 is about average.</p>
