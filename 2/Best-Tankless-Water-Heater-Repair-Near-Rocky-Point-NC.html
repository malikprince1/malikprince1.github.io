<h2>Water Heater Services Rocky Point North Carolina</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>

Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
