Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced.

Tankless heaters are space savers, consisting of a tight arrangement of coils encased in an insulated box about the size of a carry-on suitcase.</p>

Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
