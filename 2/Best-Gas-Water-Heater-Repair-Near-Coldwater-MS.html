<h2>Water Heater Services Coldwater Mississippi</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater.

<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill. When you want help navigating the often confusing waters (no pun intended) of making the best choice of water heater for your home, you'll be pleased you contacted the professionals at Petro Home Services today.

<p>Depending on your location and other components, you have a variety of options for powering your new water heater. A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>
<p>If you've experienced any of the following situations, it's time for a new water heater installation before the problem gets worse, and results in flooding.
