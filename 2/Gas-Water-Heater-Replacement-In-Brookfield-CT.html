<h2>Water Heater Services Brookfield Connecticut</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work. While the water is draining out of the old heater, Unbox the new water heater. With over 50 years of quality customer service, we specialize in the repair of residential gas and electric water heaters, tankless and commercial water heaters.</p>
<p>Your hot water heater controls the water temperature of your home or business. In a gas powered setup the components include an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, a gas control valve and a thermocouple. Luckily we at Lascko Services have the expertise needed to provide you with the very best water heater service around. A water heater replacement in most cases can be installed and working perfectly within a just a few hours as well, excluding unexpected complications.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

<p>Gas water heaters are a little different from other types of water heaters, so it is important that the technician working on the heater has the right tools and experience. Water pooling around or under your water heater is a sign of either corrosion or a damaged part. Tankless water heaters are a cost effective option for residential or commercial water heaters. Everyday tank water heaters retain large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at a time.</p>

<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot. If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to figure out what's wrong with your hot water heater on your own, so instead, make an appointment with Timothy Off.

The first step of installing a new water heater is to detach the existing one. Residential and commercial property owners who are wanting to update their water heaters typically go with tank water heaters.
