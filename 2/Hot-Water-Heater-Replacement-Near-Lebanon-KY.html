<h2>Water Heater Services Lebanon Kentucky</h2>
<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>Call an electric water heater repair person. If you are wanting to get a new water heater before a replacement is needed or you are wanting to upgrade to a new water heater, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are here to help you.

<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>

If the backflow which runs between the main water supply and the house is blocked, you have a closed plumbing system, and closed systems require an expansion to handle the pressure created when the water expands once it is heated.</p>

If you need assistance with your water heater, give us a call, and we'll provide a thorough explanation of how to fix the problem. If you want more hot water you have to use more energy.

Efficiency: The Energy Factor” (EF) indicates the energy efficiency of a tankless water heater. Picking the right hot water heater system replacement is the next task, including getting a water heater that is the right size for your hot water system installation.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>
<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
