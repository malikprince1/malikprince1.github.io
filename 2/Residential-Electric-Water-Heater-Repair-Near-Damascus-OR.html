<p>Sometimes water heaters will stop working when a pilot light goes out or if a part malfunctions. That's why the performance of tankless water heaters is measured by how many gallons per minute (GPM) the heater will deliver at a desired Temperature Rise. Larger units can heat water for your entire house. A tankless water heater not only eliminates the need for a bulky storage tank, it's a great way to reduce your household energy costs.</p>

If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
