<h2>Water Heater Services Dobbs Ferry New York</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>An especially significant motivation is the 50% reduced heating costs over using a hot water tank. If you got a water heater that only worked for two people, it's not going to work as well when there are four to 10 people working or living in space. If you already have a booster installed in your home, we are also a water heater booster repair company and we service boosters as well. Whining noises indicate sediment has built up on the heating element and will cause lower water temperatures.</p>
