<h2>Water Heater Services Mount Rainier Maryland</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Replacement Mount Rainier</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to replace a water heater is to replace like for like. That's the equivalent of taking several showers, running the dishwasher, washing one load of laundry, and turning the faucet on and off multiple times,” says John Banta, an engineer who oversees our water heater tests. Give us a call today at (770) 672-0095 to schedule your appointment for tankless water heater installation in Marietta, GA. Our technicians will work quickly and efficiently, getting your new tankless water heater installed correctly so that you do not have to ever worry about the quality of the installation.</p>
<p>Another company tried to sell me on a many-thousand-dollar replacement of an entire AC unit. California State Contractors License Board and your local municipality require a building permit for water heater replacement and new installations. Save Space - Unlike traditional water heaters that often take an entire closet of space, tankless units are much smaller in size, making them easier and more versatile to install in your home.</p>
<p>Our team of preventative maintenance specialists will give your tankless water heater a checkup every year to make sure you always have hot water whenever you want it. Any homeowners consider installing a tankless water heater in their home long before their existing water heaters have reached the end of their useful life. It only supplies hot water when you need it, eliminating standby energy loss that's associated with conventional water heaters.</p>
<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Mount Rainier MD</h3>
<p>Modern units are much more energy efficient however, so consider the money you will save on utility costs when deciding whether to repair or replace yours. Have an assistant help load the old water heater onto the appliance dolly and remove the old unit. In other installations, the solar tank is set up alongside an existing hot water tank, and the solar water preheats water for the main hot water tank. Our water heater repairs and replacements are reasonably priced and affordable, so you can rest assured that we won't bring you any hidden surprises.</p>
<p>But you save energy, since you don't have that full tank of hot water leaking heat into its surroundings 24 hours a day. Weigh the pros and cons before it's time to replace your traditional hot water heater. Tankless water heaters are a modern type of heater that work towards helping you achieve that goal. Sometimes, a water heater problem can be solved with a simple repair, in which case we will use high-quality parts.</p>
<p>A leaking water heater can't be ignored, and you may want to call us for emergency service to minimize the damage. Our Buyers Guide can help you select a new water heater, and if you decide to install the tank yourself, you will need to remove your old water heater and dispose of it properly. If you aren't sure if your water heater can be repaired, we can help. Water heaters that are not well-maintained will succumb to wear-and-tear more quickly.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Mount Rainier Maryland 20712</h3>
<p>To give you an idea of how tankless and tank-style water heaters compare in terms of size, the average 40 to 50-gallon tank-style heater is 54 to 60 inches tall with a 20-inch diameter and is shaped like a cylinder. No matter what types of repairs, maintenance, or installation services you need, let our Atlanta water heater experts handle the details so that you can get back to normal life with hot water.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Also known as instant heaters, they do not produce the standby energy losses you are likely to find with traditional heaters, thereby saving you money. To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
<p>Electric tankless hot water installation can similarly run into a variety of problems if it is not wired by professionals. A tankless water heater is a system of heating your household water that doesn't require the standard water tank of a traditional system. Your water heater is one of the most important parts of your home. Heater Size: If your unit is too small, it will not be able to heat water efficiently.</p>
