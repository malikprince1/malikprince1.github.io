<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet. If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly. Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank. They have trouble with hard water: Hard water is bad for any water heater, but the effects of hard water will negatively affect a tankless system quicker as the sediment builds up in its lines.</p>
<p>With a conventional tank heater , households with moderate to high rates of consumption will find that they can run out of hot water if they need to use a lot of hot water quickly. The gas hot water replacement cost would be between $1000 and $2500, in a different location. The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>Although it may seem like a tedious job to someone who isn't involved in the industry, our water heater replacement technicians love what they do. We also offer a one-year warranty on all our repairs, installations and products because we take pride in our work. And along with that has come the growing technology of tankless residential heaters, which can be helpful for saving money. Your next water heater doesn't have to be an energy hog.</p>

We highly recommend having your water heater installed by a professional as it is a difficult and sometimes dangerous process. That's why when it's time to equip your new home, or replace your old water heater it's important to consider cost, efficiency, and longevity of your new water heater.</p>
