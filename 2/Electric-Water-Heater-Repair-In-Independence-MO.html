<h2>Water Heater Services Independence Missouri</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>Here at Althoff, we have professional plumbers that can install any size water heater for residential and commercial buildings, and they have the knowledge, experience and skill to pull the required permits and properly install the water heater. If you are finding that your water is not getting hot enough or that it is running out quickly, it could be time for a new heating element for your water heater.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Replacement Independence</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>Water heaters are dangerous and can cause a variety of hazardous conditions both for the person attempting to tinker with the heater and for the residents of the entire household. Indirect water heaters cost $800 to $1,500 on average. If the buildup is left unattended and the tank has rusted, it is time for a new water heater altogether. Remember that water heaters for home use need lower electrical ratings compared to commercial applications.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, your hot water heater can explode and cause significant damages. Your traditional tank heater provides you with hot water after having to heat the entire tank's capacity - between 30 and 50 gallons.

Note: All plumbing installations must conform to the local plumbing code, so consult the local building department for requirements in your area.</p>
