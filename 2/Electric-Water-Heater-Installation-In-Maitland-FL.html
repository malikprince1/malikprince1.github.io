Your hot water heater doesn't have to be a behemoth. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.</p>
<p>Often, one main Tankless Water Heater will be installed near the furnace, and supplemental smaller Tankless ones will be situated in tactical spots, such as a far reaching bathrooms, etc to be located right where the water is being used.

<p>2. You can decide to replace it when you get discolored or tainted water when you turn on the hot tap. For homes with high daily water demands, multiple tankless heaters can be installed.

If you think you might have a shower, washing machine, and kitchen sink going at the same time, you'll need a unit that can supply 6 GPM (2.5 + 2.0 + 1.5 = 6.0 GPM).</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated. Depending on the unit, a gas line may need to be run to the installation point, or you may need an electrician to upgrade a panel or wire the unit into place. Water Leaks: Water leaks at the base of your water heater tank are something that needs to be addressed right away. Instead, each efficient Rinnai tankless water heater is only the size of a small suitcase.</p>

The garage (free standing or attached) is one of those not-preferable locations for the water heater installation, but sometimes it is the only one.</p>
<p>On-demand water heaters don't require repairs as often as conventional water heaters, but they do need regular service. Tankless water heaters are sized according to its maximum temperature rise possible at a given flow rate.
