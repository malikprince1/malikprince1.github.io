There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be. A water leak could be the cause as to why the hot water doesn't reach the showerhead and faucets. A cold climate can push tankless heaters right up to the limits of their capabilities.</p>

Install your black iron gas piping with a shut-off valve and a dirt leg at the water heater. If someone is not home to turn off the water to the water heater when it fails, flooding is a distinct possibility. Modern water heaters are more efficient than older units, provide consistent hot water for more extended periods, and save you more money on your monthly bill.</p>
