Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>

Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less).
