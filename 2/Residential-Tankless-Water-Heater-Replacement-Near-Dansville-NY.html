<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater.
