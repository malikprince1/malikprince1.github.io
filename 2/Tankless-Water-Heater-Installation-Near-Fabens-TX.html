Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank. They have trouble with hard water: Hard water is bad for any water heater, but the effects of hard water will negatively affect a tankless system quicker as the sediment builds up in its lines.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>Compare the water heater's STCs for Zone 3 and for Zone 4 with the minimum requirements. Tankless water heaters last an average of 5-10 years longer than tank heaters. Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
