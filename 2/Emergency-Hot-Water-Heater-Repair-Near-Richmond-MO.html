Turn off the power to the water heater in the service panel.

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>
