Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater.

Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it.

<p>Initial Cost - Tank heaters are cheaper to purchase and typically less expensive to install. However, f you use more hot water daily (around 86 gallons or more), then you may only get to enjoy an additional 8-10% energy efficiency. With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat. If your water heater malfunctions, the first step is to turn off both the power and water supply to the water heater to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>We'll ensure that your new unit is properly installed and vented, that all safety features are in place, and that the finished work conforms to approved clearance, drainage and regulatory parameters. Tankless Water Heater: If you're looking for a more energy-efficient alternative to a gas water heater, a tankless water heater could be the right choice for your home. We will assess your current and future hot-water requirements and the condition of the pipes and drains that connect to your water heater.</p>

With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>We'll make sure that it can provide plenty of hot water for you and your family and that it meets or exceeds your energy efficiency goals. Efficiency: If your water heater is of an older make and model, upgrading to a new, energy-efficient appliance will pay for itself over time.
