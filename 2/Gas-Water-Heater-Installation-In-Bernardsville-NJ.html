Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system.

<p>Your tankless hot water heater will provide as much or as little hot water as is needed at any given time. For every 2 water tanks you install, you only have to get 1 tankless water heater.
