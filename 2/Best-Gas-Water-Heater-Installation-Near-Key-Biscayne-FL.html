<h2>Water Heater Services Key Biscayne Florida</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Because this unit draws 27,000 Watts of electricity, you will need to upgrade your electric supply to a 240V, 200 Amp service. 10. You cannot run a short blast, or a fine trickle of water from the hot taps, as the tankless water heater will not activate under such a low demand flow. Deposits inside the heat exchanger can cause the outlets from the tankless system to become clogged. A heating element and a water storage tank are required in conventional heaters.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units. Call (805) 499-0448 today to begin your expert AC repair, installation, or replacement. Tank style water heaters generally last about ten years. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down.</p>

<p>Even if your family uses closer to 80 gallons of hot water daily, you can still enjoy 8% to 14% energy savings. Generally your first call for a balky water heater will be to a plumber, but if the plumber finds an electrical issue, you may need to call in a licensed electrician. Maintenance is the best way to make sure your water heater is in good condition, water heater maintenance isn't always something we think about doing.</p>
<p>Because of their size, tankless heaters can be installed in small rooms, apartments, and any other spaces which wouldn't typically allow a tank water heater. We rely on our years of experience to decide whether repairing or replacing your existing unit is more cost-effective in the long run. In addition, there may be additional tax benefits if you install one of the Bosch tankless water heaters in your home. An electric storage heater is the least expensive to buy, but it's going to cost you more to run than a gas-powered water heater.</p>

<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Key Biscayne FL</h3>
<p>3. All tankless water heaters are pretty much the same. Electric units often require a 240 volt electric for the most efficiency. In less time than you would expect, hot water flows out ready to use just as if it came from a storage type heater. Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>Efficiency is the name of the game at Payless Water Heaters, and that efficiency means one thing: less stress for you. If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation. Also, know it's purpose because if it will only be running a kitchen sink, you can get away with a model that uses less energy and save a good deal of money.</p>
<p>In addition to installing your new tankless water heater, we offer tankless water heater replacement service. If it's a conventional storage-tank water heater nearing the end of its 10 to 13-year life, replacement is obvious: New models are up to 20% more efficient and can save up to $700 in energy costs over the life of the unit. The installation cost for a tankless water heater is usually between $1,470 and $2,500.</p>

<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
