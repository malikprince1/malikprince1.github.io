<p>3. All tankless water heaters are pretty much the same. Electric units often require a 240 volt electric for the most efficiency. In less time than you would expect, hot water flows out ready to use just as if it came from a storage type heater. Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>TIP: Turn your water heater off two hours in advance to allow the water to cool. Gauging an everyday tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. The idea of refurbishing items and the selling them is nothing new to the market place, but it isn't a good idea to purchase them when it comes to particular products including tankless water heaters. The amount of time it takes to get hot water depends on how far it is from the tankless hot water heater.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of time before your water heater will need to be replaced and it is always better to schedule it out than deal with an untimely breakdown. Replacing your hot water tank can be a costly venture. In comparison, the average life expectancy of an electric tank water heater is about 12 or 13 years. If you have a bulky storage model that seems to be guzzling electricity or gas then you should replace it with the latest tankless direct vent gas version as this can enable you to save around 10% to 30% in your energy bills.</p>
