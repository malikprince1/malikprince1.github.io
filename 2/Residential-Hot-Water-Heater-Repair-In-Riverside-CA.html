<h2>Water Heater Services Riverside California</h2>
<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater. If your water heater is older and you need frequent repairs to keep it running smoothly, a new unit is likely a good idea.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Installation Riverside</h3>
<p>Repaired 40 gallon gas water heater and installed thermal expansion tank. Perhaps a tankless water heater is right for you. Compared to traditional water heaters, tankless water heaters are smaller and can help you make the most out of your property's utility room space. When hot water is turned on at the faucet, a series of high-efficiency heating elements come to life, quickly heating the water as it passes through the system.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
<p>The water heater isn't producing hot water. However, as with a traditional tank-style water heater they will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. If you notice several of the above symptoms it's likely your hot water heater is failing and it needs to be repaired or replaced. Although they can be a bit more expensive than the traditional models, the benefits you have on the tankless is satisfactory compare to the traditional water heater.</p>
<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns. If installed properly, your tankless water heater should not require much maintenance and can run for twice as long as a conventional storage (tank) water heater.</p>

If your household's hot water consumption is 41 gallons and below, you can save as much as 34 percent in energy usage.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>
<p>If you have a gas hot water heater, the pilot light might go out and leave you without hot water. Our Lombard water heater installers will assess the problem and present you with accurate solutions.
