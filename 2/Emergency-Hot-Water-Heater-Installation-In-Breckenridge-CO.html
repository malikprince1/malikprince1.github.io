<h2>Water Heater Services Breckenridge Colorado</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>If there weren't a dip tube the incoming cold water would constantly be cooling down the heated water and you would think that something is wrong with the heater because you are quickly running out of hot water.

There are many different types of water heaters on the market.</p>
