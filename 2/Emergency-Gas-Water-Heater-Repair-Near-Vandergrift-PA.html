Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000. Gas water heater: Turn off the gas supply at the shutoff valve on the gas pipe nearest the water heater.</p>

All these noises are an indication that the water heater system is working too hard, and it can cause damage to the interior of your tank. Water heater is over ten years old. Additional costs include other materials needed for installation (heat pumps, water pumps, pipes, etc.) and the costs associated with permitting These may add $250 to $500 to the final cost.</p>
