Ideally, a full flush will be performed, but in which case the heater has to be turned off beforehand and the tank has to be full.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>

Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
