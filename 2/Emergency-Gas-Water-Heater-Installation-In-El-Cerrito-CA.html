<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation El Cerrito</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>Tankless electric units have shorter life spans, on the order of 7 to 10 years. Your vent is undersized at 3”. This application requires a short water heater, a minimum of a 12” connector rise, 4” vent, and a new gas cock. Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters. For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>
<p>Our local, family-owned business has been providing water heater services in Roseville, Rocklin, Granite Bay, Lincoln, Auburn and the surrounding areas. There are now models that offer more firepower, while keeping equipment and installation costs down. You will need to know how to shut off the gas supply to the existing water heater and disconnect the tank without releasing gas. KEEP YOUR INDOOR PLUMBING WARM - Open your kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow heat to get to pipes under sinks and vanities near exterior walls, and keep a small trickle of water running at vulnerable cold and hot faucets.</p>
<p>Most of the time, if you are not getting hot water, it is because the pilot light on your water heater is out. It is recommended that you hire a licensed, professional to install your water heater. We are the leading water heaters company in the region and are known for providing prompt and high quality gas & electric water heater repair services.

<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>If the pressure is much lower now, you either need to limit your hot water demand or ask a plumber about upgrading your tankless water heater. When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem.
