<h2>Water Heater Services Wilton Connecticut</h2>
<p>Your water heater is one of the single most expensive components of your plumbing system. Typically, Houston water heater tanks are made of steel and lined with glass to prevent the steel from rusting. We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages.

Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>

He decides to remove and replace his failing water heater with a tankless water heater, and walks us through the process. Beyond the initial cost, the national average for the installation of a tankless unit is slightly over $1,700.
