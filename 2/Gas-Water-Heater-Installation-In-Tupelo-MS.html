<h2>Water Heater Services Tupelo Mississippi</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

Lower initial cost - A traditional water heater installation can be half as much as a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>This could result in precious pre-heated air from within your home being sucked into the heater creating a negative pressure, while any exhaust gases could be released inside the house itself and pose a danger to you and your loved ones. Call 480-212-6587 and ask the experts at Affordable Plumbing, Rooter and Water Heaters about the benefits of a tankless water heater. These requirements are an important part of the government's efforts to improve the energy and water efficiency of homes and to lower greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The electric radiant heat system is usually hooked up to a dedicated GFIC-protected circuit and a thermostat with an automatic timer to control the temperature and times.

<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Tupelo MS</h3>
<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>
<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>

Our Buyers Guide can help you select a new water heater, and if you decide to install the tank yourself, you will need to remove your old water heater and dispose of it properly. If you aren't sure if your water heater can be repaired, we can help. Water heaters that are not well-maintained will succumb to wear-and-tear more quickly.</p>
