Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, installing a tankless system will be a good step at reducing your energy consumption and by just installing one, it will knock money off the utility bill.
