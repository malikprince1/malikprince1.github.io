You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water.

<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank.

With our regular water heater repair and maintenance services, we can extend the life of your system, reduce the risk for water leaks, and improve the control over your water temperature.

Get up to 36 months to pay for your new water heater, subject to credit approval. Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>

One safety features that a Paloma digital tankless heater has is protection against fire.
