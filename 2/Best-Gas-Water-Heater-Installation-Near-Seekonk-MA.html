What it means for you is that using a tankless electric heater you will never run out of hot water while in the shower. Sometimes individual units are used in a number of locations throughout a house, but most newer homes have one high-output tankless heater to supply hot water throughout the home.

In this way, you can have hot water whenever you need it without paying to heat a full tank 24 hours a day.
