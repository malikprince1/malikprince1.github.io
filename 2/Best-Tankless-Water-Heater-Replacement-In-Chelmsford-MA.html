The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>You'll also save in repair and maintenance costs, as well, because tankless units tend to have fewer problems like leaks.
