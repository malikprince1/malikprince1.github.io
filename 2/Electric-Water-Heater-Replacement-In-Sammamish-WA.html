To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house”-type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water. There is a heating mechanism at the bottom that heats the water which then rises to the top of the tank. Hot water tanks are rated for their Energy Factor” (EF) which measures how much hot water is produced per unit of fuel.</p>

After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels.

<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations. A gas water heater typically will have an EF between 0.50 and 0.80, with electric heaters around 0.90. A higher EF means more energy-efficiency and likely lower operating costs. Hot water system installation cost depends on your plumber. ClimateCare members are trained to repair every make and model of water heater, and update their training when new technologies enter the market.</p>

Many manufacturer's and plumbers recommend that a water softener is installed when you have a tankless water heater.</p>
