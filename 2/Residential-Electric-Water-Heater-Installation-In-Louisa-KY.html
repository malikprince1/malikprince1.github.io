<h2>Water Heater Services Louisa Kentucky</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries. A tankless water heater will last about twenty(20) years, while a conventional water heater may only last ten(10) to thirteen(13) years or less (depending on the quality of your water). He quickly identified the issue (lower heating element not working) and explained the situation (very old water heater) and my options to address in a very easy to understand manner.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

Compare the cost of electricity consumed and the heating method.</p>
<p>Water heaters are dangerous and can cause a variety of hazardous conditions both for the person attempting to tinker with the heater and for the residents of the entire household. Indirect water heaters cost $800 to $1,500 on average. If the buildup is left unattended and the tank has rusted, it is time for a new water heater altogether.
