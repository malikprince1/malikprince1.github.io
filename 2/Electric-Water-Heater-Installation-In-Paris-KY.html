A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap.

<p>A lot goes into installation, including safety, plumbing permits from the county, and gas, electrical, or other connections.

<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust.
