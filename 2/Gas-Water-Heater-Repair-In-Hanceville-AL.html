<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Get the job done right the first time, Barstow & Sons Heating & Cooling will see to it that our team of trained technicians is out to you right away to provide you with an estimate and get the job started as soon as possible.

Tank-type water heaters not only heat water but also store it in a tank until it's ready for use.</p>
<p>If your water heater is around 10 years old and it's got a major mechanical problem, replacement is usually your best option. Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing. What this example shows us, though, is that the upfront costs of a whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly 2 to 2.5 times more expensive than a high-efficiency gas storage water heater and a high-efficiency is less expensive to own than a conventional gas storage water heater.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
