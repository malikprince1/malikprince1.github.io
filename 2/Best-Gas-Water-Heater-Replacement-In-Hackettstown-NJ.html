For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
<p>The pipe that runs through the center of the tank and comes out at the top transfers the heat from the gas to the water. This is absolutely crucial, and one of the most important reasons to consider professional water heater installation services in North Jersey.
