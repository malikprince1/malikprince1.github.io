<h2>Water Heater Services La Jolla California</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>The voltage of most heaters range between 110V to 277V. This could happen at the top or bottom of the water heater, where the pipes come out. However, if your water looks rusty, has a funky smell, or produces a strange noise, it's time to call a professional for a hot water heater repair. The mobile home water heater never gets looked at till it breaks down, but just like your central heating boiler ay home, it should be serviced annually.</p>
