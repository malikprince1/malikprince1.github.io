However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>

<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
