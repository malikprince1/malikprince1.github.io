This type of system uses the same type of panels and liquid system, but instead to transfer solar energy for only the hot water tank, heated fluid flows through a system that can heat up the entire house. Since you are dealing with gas, you will want to ensure that you are using a qualified plumber for this replacement. The cold water is then heated rises up and becomes evenly dispersed throughout the tank.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
