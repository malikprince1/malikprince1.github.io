Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>

<p>Pick the water heater that best fits your water usage, lifestyle situation, and budget. When you are not using hot water, the heater's internal sensor automatically switches off the heat exchanger. However, installation costs are lower owing the absence of a furnace.

<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

<p>Replacing a hot water heater just became an experience people will look forward to. Hard vs. soft water If you have hard water and no water softener, cleaning a tankless system can be time-consuming. Use the links below to compare the prices of popular tank and tankless water heaters. Tankless units with digital connectivity let you adjust the temperature and monitor gas and hot-water usage on your phone. Tankless hot water heaters are rated by how many gallons of hot water they produce per minute.</p>
<p>The Temperature and Pressure Relief Valve (TPR) is an essential water heater safety feature. Replacing your water heater with a new, more efficient one, could lower your high energy bills. Turn on a faucet, and there it is. When it runs out, it has to consume energy to bring new water up to temperature. While they're picking up the new one, tell them to slap some flexible pipe connections on your credit card, too, in case your new water heater's dimensions aren't the same as the old one's.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
