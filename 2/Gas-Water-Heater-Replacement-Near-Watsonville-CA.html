While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>When you call Trusted Plumbing one of our specialists will send a plumber to you on your schedule to do an inspection or give you a free estimate for a new water heater installation over the phone at 206-208-0007.

Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
