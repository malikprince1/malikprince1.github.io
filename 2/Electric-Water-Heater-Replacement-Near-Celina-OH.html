<p>Need a Tank Water Heater Installation? At the very least, you could break even while reducing the number of times that you'll need to replace your water heater. While DIY repairs can save you some time and money, it can also be messy, and there's the risk of electrical exposure with certain repairs.

Leak repair: If you notice water anywhere near the unit, call a plumber right away.</p>
