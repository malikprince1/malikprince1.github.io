Deposits inside the heat exchanger can cause the outlets from the tankless system to become clogged. A heating element and a water storage tank are required in conventional heaters.</p>

If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional.

<p>Tankless electric units emit zero greenhouse gasses and are 20%-30% more efficient than ones with a tank.

Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
