<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose. While tankless water heaters are a great alternative to traditional tank water heaters, there are some things to consider before you purchase and allow Barstow and Sons to install them professionally. As with any other appliance or component of your home, proper maintenance is essential to maximize the lifespan of your water heater.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

This strategy saves water as well as energy, thereby making this option one of the most efficient, as well as saving on space.</p>
<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement.
