If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>

Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>

A direct vent water heater is basically a sealed unit that has either two pipes or a concentric pipe pipe within pipe to suck in fresh air from outside the bathroom and also dispense exhaust gases outside. Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
