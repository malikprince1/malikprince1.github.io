The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement.

<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Jacksonville</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Get your water heater flushed out regularly to keep it running well. The only greater percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless units only operate when you need hot water, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs by up to 35%.

<p>Tankless, or on-demand water heaters are growing in popularity, largely due to their ability to produce an endless supply of hot water, despite the amount of usage. Keep in mind that the capacity, wattage, and output of the water heaters vary dramatically, hence the flux in prices. You may run into legal problems if you try to convert your home to a tankless water heater system without the proper permits. Tankless water heaters, sometimes referred to as on demand water heaters, create instant hot water without the use of a water storage tank.</p>

<p>If you're anything like the average homeowner, you use your water heater daily. Along with the insulated foam, water heaters are now made with a glass liner inside to prevent corrosion from the minerals in the water. Installing a gas tankless water heater involves mounting the unit, connecting gas and water lines, and installing a flue. Electric water heaters tend to only last 8 to 10 years before they need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Next, your installer will mount the actual heating unit. For most households, the ideal hot water temperature is between 120 and 140 degrees. Instead of fighting over who gets the first shower in the morning, you don't have to worry about that with a new water heater. When you turn the hot water tap off the heat exchanger shuts down, saving energy and money. B&B Heating & Cooling are Homer Glen's tankless water heater specialists.</p>
