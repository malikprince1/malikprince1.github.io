<h2>Water Heater Services Vienna Georgia</h2>
<p>A hot water heater problem poses a lot of stress to households in cold areas. Replacing the dip tube also requires removing the cold water pipe, and changing out the heating element requires dealing with 220 volt electricity, so if you're not experienced with plumbing and electrical work, it may be best to leave these jobs to your local master plumber In addition, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to a skilled technician in order to avoid the risk of fire, gas leaks, or personal injury.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>The conventional gas storage water heater is roughly $100 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over the same 15 year time period. This provides an endless supply of hot water regardless of how many people need to take showers, how much laundry needs to get done, or how often you need to run the dishwasher. Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Installation Vienna</h3>
<p>Give us a call at (815) 873-6003 to schedule your water heater replacement. Plumbers can also advise on which brands are suitable and good to use, since many heaters need annual maintenance.

<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
