<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on.

Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
