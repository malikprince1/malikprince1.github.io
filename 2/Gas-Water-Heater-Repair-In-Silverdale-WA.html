<h2>Water Heater Services Silverdale Washington</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters are cheaper than the gas versions. Save more with exclusive offers and valuable coupons from Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning.

<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
