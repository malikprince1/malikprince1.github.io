Before you decide to purchase a new water heater, you may want to determine if it can, in fact, be repaired. Tankless water heaters can be sized to provide a continuous flow of hot water, making them suitable for large families that use a lot of hot water at one time.</p>

A standard water heater is comprised of a large tank that holds around 60 to 100 gallons of water.</p>

<p>3. All tankless water heaters are pretty much the same. Electric units often require a 240 volt electric for the most efficiency. In less time than you would expect, hot water flows out ready to use just as if it came from a storage type heater. Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced. Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models.

Best performance comes from gas units, as electric units are not Energy Star-rated. Many homeowners in our area are choosing to switch to a tankless water heater for many reasons. Homeowners are so attached to the idea of storage tanks when it comes to hot water that they find it a bit difficult to imagine how a tankless system might operate.</p>

<p>This is the product that you probably first envision when you think of a hot water heater. If you notice any of the above issues occurring, you need a tankless water heater repair or a service visit. Switching to an energy efficient tankless system provides up to $1500 in tax incentives.

This is because the hot water sitting in the pipes will eventually cool down if you don't use it. Tankless water heaters come in a variety of sizes for different applications, such as a whole-house tankless water heater, a source for a remote bathroom or hot tub, or as a boiler to provide hot water for a home heating system.</p>
<p>If electric you will probably need 220 volt service run to the location where the unit will be installed, which can also be some what expensive. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas inside the premises, it is an emergency situation, you need to call water heaters repair services urgently. That means you will always get 120° water from your hot faucet when you turn it on, until the tank begins to replenish the tank from the cold water source.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter's water heater comparison guide is a great starting point to familiarize yourself with what's out there. This is a sign that the water heater will need a repair visit soon. This is particularly true in cold weather climates: If the ground water being pumped into the tankless system is already very cold, it will take longer to heat up than a traditional system. Electric water heaters use electricity to heat water.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
