<h2>Water Heater Services Kutztown Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Other water heater brands currently on the market include: Bradford White, EcoSmart, Rinnai, and State. All you need to do to receive a continuous, consistent supply of hot water is turn the unit on” by just opening the hot water faucet.

We can come to your house, inspect your water heater, and help you determine the best replacement timeline and option.</p>
<p>If you want your water heater to be replaced with a Mike Diamond Plumbing water heater we are happy to still keep your planned appointment.
