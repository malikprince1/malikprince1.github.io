If you're doing a water heater replacement, we'll talk you through the pros and cons of a tankless one.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters use a storage tank that keeps water heated by the sun. For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores). Tankless water heaters are different in their rating system—they are sold according to the demand they can meet, the flow rate, and are measured in gallons per minute (GPM). If you're running out of hot water too quickly, there are a couple things to check.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Vinton</h3>
<p>It is certainly true that tankless water heaters, technically speaking, really are more efficient than most tank type water heaters, even if the manufacturers' claims might be a little optimistic. After years of wear and tear, it may be time to schedule a water heater replacement. This requires energy (fuel) even when you don't need hot water. The two types of solar water heating systems are known as flat plate collectors and batch collectors.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>We install tankless water heaters for commercial and residential customers in the South Bay & Los Angeles, including Torrance, Redondo Beach, Harbor City & surrounding areas. One of the biggest and least talked about drawbacks to tankless water heaters is that hard water destroys them. The beauty of investing in a tankless water heater is that it only uses energy when you are using it. When you need to take a shower, wash your hands, or do a load of laundry using warm water, the tankless water heater will heat up water on demand.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

The only higher percentage is heating and cooling costs. One of the lesser-known downsides of tankless water heaters is that they have difficulty achieving a lukewarm water temperature. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time might stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.</p>
<p>By installing it as a point of use water heater, you will get instant hot water as soon as you turn on the faucet.

Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
