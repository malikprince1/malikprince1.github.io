<p>There is no way around it.

<p>Failed heating elements, faulty water heater thermostats, or discolored water all indicate a problem with your water heater.

However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
