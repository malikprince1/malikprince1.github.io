<h2>Water Heater Services Lake Station Indiana</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
