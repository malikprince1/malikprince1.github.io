<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>Gas hot water system installation cost is typically between $250 and $700 to replace an old hot water system with the same type in the same spot.
