New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
