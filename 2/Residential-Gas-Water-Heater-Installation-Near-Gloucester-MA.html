<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair , maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from skilled plumbing experts. It's also advantageous to preemptively upgrade an obsolete water heater to a new model that's more reliable and efficient. Terrano Plumbing and Remodeling proudly endorse Noritz Gas Tankless water heaters as the #1 gas tankless in the industry for residential and commercial applications. Trouble is, most homeowners are unaware of when a water heater reaches its expiration date. Depending on the size of your water heater, this could take a while.</p>
<p>Because this unit draws 27,000 Watts of electricity, you will need to upgrade your electric supply to a 240V, 200 Amp service. 10. You cannot run a short blast, or a fine trickle of water from the hot taps, as the tankless water heater will not activate under such a low demand flow.
