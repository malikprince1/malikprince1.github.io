<h2>Water Heater Services Southgate Michigan</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we imagine doing things very easy. The most important component in the tankless water heater is the heat exchanger; this component requires periodic flushing. If we believe that we can repair your hot water heater, we'll complete repairs on the spot. Whether you live in a historic house with vintage pipes or a brand new home with state-of-the-art systems, Lakewood Plumbing & Heating can handle any plumbing challenge.

<p>Other water heater brands currently on the market include: Bradford White, EcoSmart, Rinnai, and State. All you need to do to receive a continuous, consistent supply of hot water is turn the unit on” by just opening the hot water faucet. Showering immediately after running the dishwasher is also out because this activity uses up a lot of hot water and drains the tank significantly. We can come to your house, inspect your water heater, and help you determine the best replacement timeline and option.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters (such as demand-type water heaters and tankless coil water heaters) prevent standby heat losses. When you multiply that usage by each household member, the demands placed on the water heater is brought into perspective. Small families and studio apartments can often use a 20 gallon electric or tankless water heater (if the apartments are on individual units). When it comes to water heaters, repair isn't always the most cost-effective option.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Replacement Southgate</h3>
<p>At Epic Plumbing, we specialize in tankless water heater services to benefit our customers for the long haul. Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>Water heater replacement: Your water heater works harder than any other plumbing fixture in your Chicago home. Make sure that the gas valve is turned on. If you have a gas tankless water heater, find the gas valve ( seen here as the gas supply” ). If it's in the OFF position, just rotate the handle counter-clockwise to the ON position. First you're going to want to turn off the gas, power, and water supply to the tank.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>

<p>Age: If your unit is older, and especially if it requires repairs or replacement parts to keep it functioning, it can be more cost-effective to install a new unit. Frequent breakdowns are a good indicator that it may be time for a full water heater replacement. Tank-style heaters don't produce hot water instantly either but since they have a supply ready to go and don't need to kick on, it reaches the outlet more quickly.</p>

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>We'll update you about your water heater repair appointment via text, email or phone-whichever you prefer. Homes without a gas line or propane tank can also enjoy the advantages of on-demand hot water by installing tankless units powered by electricity. Again, this is no longer a tankless water heater, however.
