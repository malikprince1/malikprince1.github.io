<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Knox</h3>

Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters. For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>
