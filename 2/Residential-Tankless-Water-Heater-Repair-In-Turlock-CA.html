Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank. However, from time to time, something can happen which will require you to have to look for a quality water heater repair service.</p>

Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of monthly utilities.

Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>
