<h2>Water Heater Services Balch Springs Texas</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Plumbers can contact the plumbers' water heater information line on 1300 883 019 (Monday to Friday, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm) for assistance. Water flow automatically ignites the water heater's burner, and your water is heated as it follows a serpentine path through the heating element. Having your water heater checked for gas leaks, water leaks and Carbon Monoxide off gassing is crucial for all home owners in the life of a water heater.</p>

<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater.

Finally, your installer or electrician can connect your new tankless water heater to your home's electrical systems. The water doesn't pool in the tank as it does with a standard tank type of water heater where it must fill the tank to a certain level before the heating element even starts. No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
