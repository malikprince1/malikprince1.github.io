<p>Tankless water heaters are not a simple swap out.” Most conventional gas water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. No storage tank saves valuable space. The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity. When you turn the hot water tap in a home with a tankless water heater, a powerful gas or electric heater kicks on and instantly heats water running through coils in the unit.</p>
