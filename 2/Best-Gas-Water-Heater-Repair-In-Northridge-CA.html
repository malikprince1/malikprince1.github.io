<h2>Water Heater Services Northridge California</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we imagine doing things very easy. The most important component in the tankless water heater is the heat exchanger; this component requires periodic flushing. If we believe that we can repair your hot water heater, we'll complete repairs on the spot. Whether you live in a historic house with vintage pipes or a brand new home with state-of-the-art systems, Lakewood Plumbing & Heating can handle any plumbing challenge. If the water heater in your Katy home is down for the count, call the experts at BVS at 281-391-1510 or contact us online today to schedule an appointment for water heater service.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Northridge</h3>

<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced. Sometimes they are called an in-line heater, as it only heats the water it needs as it passes through, and therefore energy is not wasted by heating extra water all day that is not in use. Knochelmann Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning has skills to repair your water heater and have your household back to normal.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>Disconnect the electrical wires on the top of the water heater. What's more, since their introduction in the United States in the 1990s, tankless heaters have become increasingly sophisticated, with features like built-in recirculating pumps (for instant” hot water), and wireless connectivity that tells you via smartphone exactly when a unit needs maintenance. In that scenario the person is left waiting for the tank of water to become heated to the set temperature.</p>

The key feature is that the heater does not turn on until it senses that a hot water tap is being opened. They only heat the water as it's needed, unlike storage tank water heaters that require continuous maintenance of the temperature of the water in the tank.</p>
<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
