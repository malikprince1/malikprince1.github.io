<h2>Water Heater Services Brighton Michigan</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>
<p>Contamination Trap - This device helps to minimize the amount of sediment that might accumulate at the bottom of your water heater tank. For all of your plumbing needs - from emergencies to routine maintenance - call Reliability Home Services at (443) 399-8663. Unlimited hot water: While traditional water heaters are limited to the amount of hot water in the tank, tankless units can provide unlimited hot water.</p>

<p>These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the water heater, where incoming cold water can absord the heat. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. The life expectancy of a water heater is typically eight to twelve years and, here in our area, it will typically be fueled by gas or electric. Follow these steps to install the new water heater. But there is one possibility of resolving these problems once and for all, and that is a tankless water heater.</p>

<p>July 1, 2007 - WH conversion to FVIR design has been extended to all residential water heaters with inputs of 75 000 BTU's or less including Power Direct-Vent, Direct-Vent, Manufactured Housing and larger gallon capacity models not covered in the first two phases. Improper installation of a water heater could cause catastrophic damage or injury if the unit is not installed properly. Single-point electric tankless units start at around $115, or gas-powered, single-point tankless can be used to supplement for about $130.</p>
<p>Also, if you live in an area where most of the homes are upgrading to tankless units, it may be a good idea to do the same so your property remains in competitive with the rest of the area homes (from a real estate standpoint). The gas tankless water heater installation cost would also be in the $250 and $700 range to replace an old tankless system with the same type in the same spot. This type of heater depends on the application and the availability of the other types.</p>

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>If electric you will probably need 220 volt service run to the location where the unit will be installed, which can also be some what expensive. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas inside the premises, it is an emergency situation, you need to call water heaters repair services urgently. That means you will always get 120° water from your hot faucet when you turn it on, until the tank begins to replenish the tank from the cold water source.</p>
<p>As opposed to the more traditional way of heating water with a water tank, the wait is far less for the water to heat up and stays hotter for longer while using less energy. A family that needs frequently needs a large volume hot water (running the shower, dishwasher, and washing machine at the same time, for example), may find that a tankless water heater can't supply enough hot water to meet their needs.</p>
