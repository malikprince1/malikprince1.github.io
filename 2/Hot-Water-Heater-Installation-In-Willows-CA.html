You don't get the problem of frequent maintenance or servicing with a Rinnai tankless water heater, because there's no tank to leak or break and no risk of flooding. Instead, a Rinnai® tankless water heater with ThermaCirc360() technology recirculates hot water through your pipes, so as soon as you open the tap, you'll get hot water within seconds, not minutes. If you are switching from electric to a gas water heater installation, the gas hot water heater installation cost would typically be in the $1200 to $3000 range.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Our menu of home services includes HVAC Installation, windows, plumbing, duct, and Insulation. A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank.
