<h2>Water Heater Services Elma Washington</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>The Energy Factor (EF) rating on the label will tell you have efficient the hot water heater is at transferring heat from the energy source to the water. If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation. Consumer Reports recently tested several electric and gas whole-house tankless water heaters from brands such as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Repair Elma</h3>
<p>There are some common problems that can happen with the water heater, such as, discolored water, foul-smelling water, leaking tank or odd noises coming from the tank. We'll complete your replacement quickly and efficiently, hauling away your old water heater and disposing of it at the proper facility. It is inserted into the cold water inlet side of the heater with the flared end at the top of the heater.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater. The electric tankless unit will only heat the water that you use and does not have the standby heat loss that typically comes with traditional tank-type products.

<p>Traditional tanked storage water heaters are the most commonly found type of water heaters in homes today. If you have a current water heater that needs to be removed, or if your home needs electrical or structural updates to hold the new unit, these will add on to your final cost.

<p>Place the water heater in a drip pan made for this purpose if the equipment is located inside the home, and especially if it is in the attic. Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>
<p>Our well-trained plumbing specialists can perform any water heater repair that comes our way in Charleston. You'll never need to worry about a ruptured tank flooding the basement, water absorbing contaminants from the tank, or standby energy losses. You will only generate hot water when you need it. Not only do tankless water heaters save energy and money; they take up significantly less space because there is no need for a bulky tank.</p>
<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time. They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork. Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
