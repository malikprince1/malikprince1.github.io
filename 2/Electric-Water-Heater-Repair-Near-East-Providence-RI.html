<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement East Providence</h3>
<p>South Jersey Energy Service Plus is proud to offer our customers the following additional water heaters services. Electric water heaters tend to be more energy-efficient than gas water heaters, but the cost of electricity can make the electric the more expensive choice. Whereas with a tankless hot water heater all you have to do is turn off the water supply to that location disconnect the supply lines and you are basically finished.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>

<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place. Before finding the right plumber, you should know everything that goes into the cost of repairing a hot water heater.</p>

This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts.

Prior to buying the hot & electric heaters you can even go through the online reviews. Something else to think about is if you can't upgrade to a larger conventional water heater because it may not fit. If you have limited space in your utility room or you like saving money on the energy bill and having consistent hot water, you need a tankless water heater installation estimate from AC Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
