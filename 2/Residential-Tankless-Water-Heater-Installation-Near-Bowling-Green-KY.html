With the amount of money you'll save on energy costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and longer-lasting nature of these systems, you'll enjoy safer and more reliable warm water for longer, which keeps more money in your pocket where it belongs. For instance, less natural resources go into the manufacturing of these compact size heaters.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>

A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank. A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>
<p>But because these tankless gas units last longer, the savings kicks in after six years, about when many tanks are nearing their demise. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger delivering it directly to your faucets or shower without using a storage tank. Whether you're in central Austin, or a surrounding city such as Lakeway, Bee Caves, Round Rock, Westlake Hills or Georgetown, TX, there is always potential for your water heater to experience one of these issues.</p>
