<h2>Water Heater Services Ledyard Connecticut</h2>
<p>A hot water heater problem poses a lot of stress to households in cold areas. Replacing the dip tube also requires removing the cold water pipe, and changing out the heating element requires dealing with 220 volt electricity, so if you're not experienced with plumbing and electrical work, it may be best to leave these jobs to your local master plumber In addition, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to a skilled technician in order to avoid the risk of fire, gas leaks, or personal injury.</p>

Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
