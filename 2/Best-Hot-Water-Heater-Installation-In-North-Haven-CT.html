<h2>Water Heater Services North Haven Connecticut</h2>
<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The sentiment has also moved into the world of plumbing, where tankless water heaters have become popular for their ability to deliver hot water anytime it's needed. The first place to look would be the energy efficiency ratings of tank and tankless models. Tankless systems cost twice as much as traditional tank units, however because they only heat water only at the time it is being used, they are far more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible. Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater. It is best to have a professional take care of these type of issues as there are electrical and water hazards involved in making these repairs. Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>Outside of the GPM produced by most tankless heaters, there are a few heaters that go beyond the average, heating 7.5-11 GPM. Tankless water heaters feature an adjustable thermostat control. Don't pay to heat a tank full of water while away or worry about a tank water heater springing a leak. To install this, you will need some tape measure, a spirit level, a square edge, a pencil, an electric drill, a drill bit and a fixing kit suitable for the wall, a T&P valve and drain, a wrench, a hammer, oakum, jointing compound.</p>
<p>You can install a standalone heat pump water heater or combine your water heater with your heating and cooling system, employing an air or ground source heat pump. Reverse the tank orientation so that water pipes do not travel over or near the electrical wiring. This will vary by location and complexity of the hot water system installation, so it pays to get about 3 quotes. With energy costs on the rise, it may be time for you to consider switching to tankless.</p>
<p>If it doesn't ignite, leave the hot water running and try lowering and then raising the temperature setting on the dial until the burner ignites. The question of are tankless water heaters worth it is a question of balancing the long-term and short-term costs of different types of heaters. The latest technology can be found in the on demand water heaters. In addition, water damage due to poor maintenance of your home isn't covered.</p>

<p>We can help you determine whether your water heater can be repaired or if water heater replacement is the most cost-effective long-term option. Because water is only heated when it's needed, it uses much less energy. While tankless water heater repair is very important, it can be hard for a lot of people to know when repairs are needed. Our plumbers are also trained to help decrease the amount of energy required to heat your water.</p>
<p>You'll also need assistance because water heaters are heavy and bulky, making them difficult to handle. With a tankless unit in place, you can rest assured knowing the system will provide clean and fresh water to your faucets. Most standard tankless water heaters have a lifespan of up to 20 years when properly maintained. Discolored water observed when hot water is coming out of your faucet, is a sign of excess scale built up inside your heater tank.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
