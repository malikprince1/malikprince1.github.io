<p>This saves you more on energy costs. Energy efficiency was Excellent and annual operating costs were low, just $240. Tankless water heaters also typically have a longer warranty. Prior to buying the hot & electric heaters you can even go through the online reviews. Something else to think about is if you can't upgrade to a larger conventional water heater because it may not fit. If you have limited space in your utility room or you like saving money on the energy bill and having consistent hot water, you need a tankless water heater installation estimate from AC Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
