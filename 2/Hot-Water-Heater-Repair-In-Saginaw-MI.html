<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>

<p>In Denver, any plumber who is licensed by the Colorado Plumbing Board and the City and County of Denver can handle almost all water heater problems. As the water heats, pressure builds inside the tank. The first tankless water heaters were only about two feet by three feet and bumped out from the wall about 12 or more inches.

And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs.
