<h2>Water Heater Services Galt California</h2>
<p>For both traditional and tankless water heaters, the thermostat is one of the most frequent culprits when it comes to malfunctions. Hold the hot water heater against the desired wall. For the ultimate in tank water heater power, but with the efficiency of a tankless system, a hybrid water heater makes an excellent solution. If you're not totally happy with our installation work the first time, we'll redo the job on our own dime. The points above show the benefits of installing tankless hot water heater. Doctor Fix it installs all makes and models of water heaters, and can also educate you about the benefits of Tankless Water Heaters as another option for endless hot water.</p>
<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Galt</h3>

We realize the cost effects of outdated technology on your energy bills and we can help you upgrade to an efficient design that helps you save costs.</p>
<p>Typically, tankless water heaters furnish heated up water at a speed around 2 - 5 gallons every minute. With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer. When it comes time to replace yours, chances are, you'll pick the same type of unit - either gas or electric. It is estimated that 5-10 million hot water tanks go to the landfill each year. When your water heater beings to deteriorate, you can see how it affects your daily comfort.</p>

Self-cleaning units automatically fight lime and sediment buildup to lengthen tank life and maintain peak efficiency for a longer period.

Our trained and certified plumbers will provide you with an honest, upfront price on the cost to install a tankless water heater ($29 or FREE if you choose us to install your water heater).

We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>Of course, if you keep running out of hot water , your water heater could be failing, or there might be sediment buildup that needs to be flushed out of the tank. Efficiency: The Energy Factor” (EF) indicates the energy efficiency of a tankless water heater. Picking the right hot water heater system replacement is the next task, including getting a water heater that is the right size for your hot water system installation.</p>
<p>It's important to get a large enough tankless water heater to make sure that adequate hot water flow is available.

Water Heaters Only Inc has been specializing in water heater replacement since 1968. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings.</p>

While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>Because it's constantly heating and reheating water throughout the day. Heating your water can consume a lot of energy. Water heaters should be serviced regularly in order to preserve their functionality, and repairs may be necessary after substantial use or as the heater grows older, however, they simply don't last forever. Heaters can switch off if there is low water pressure, so the minimum flow rate specification is important here and it has limited capacity for heating.</p>
