<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Gwinn MI</h3>
<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>Efficiency is the name of the game at Payless Water Heaters, and that efficiency means one thing: less stress for you. If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation.

<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters. Many manufacturer's and plumbers recommend that a water softener is installed when you have a tankless water heater.</p>

<p>As opposed to the more traditional way of heating water with a water tank, the wait is far less for the water to heat up and stays hotter for longer while using less energy. A family that needs frequently needs a large volume hot water (running the shower, dishwasher, and washing machine at the same time, for example), may find that a tankless water heater can't supply enough hot water to meet their needs.</p>
<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
