<h2>Water Heater Services Folsom California</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose. While tankless water heaters are a great alternative to traditional tank water heaters, there are some things to consider before you purchase and allow Barstow and Sons to install them professionally. As with any other appliance or component of your home, proper maintenance is essential to maximize the lifespan of your water heater.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, tankless hot water heaters can be installed on most flush wall surfaces, as long as they have access to fuel and water lines (which should already be taken care of). A point-of-use (POU) electric tankless water heater should not be a problem in terms of amperage requirements. VIP Plumbing's team is ready to provide the service, repair or replace your existing boiler with a high-efficiency system from Navien or Weil-Mclain to improve your Solon home comfort and lower your utility and fuel costs.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Folsom</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>
<p>Get endless on-demand hot water, space savings, eco-efficiency and peace of mind from the world's most reliable tankless gas water heater brand. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas coming from its location, you have a potentially dangerous situation on your hands. In electric water heaters, if hot water comes out for a very short span of time, the first thing to check is the thermostat setting. No storage or holding tank means that tankless water heaters have a life span twice as long as traditional systems because the risk of rust and corrosion is significantly lower.</p>
<p>4. Replacing with a tankless water heater doesn't require a permit or inspection. A point-of-use unit provides hot water for a single fixture. When demand is high, a traditional tank heater can run out, leaving you (or a family member or guests) in the cold. Our water heater installation experts will discuss all of the different options available to you, discuss the benefits of gas water heaters versus electric water heaters, and help you make the most energy and cost efficient solution for your home.</p>
<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Folsom CA</h3>
<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>
<p>The Powerstar AE125 electric tankless water heater has a life expectancy of about 20 years. The upper one controls both heating elements while the lower one only controls one heating element. A tankless water heater only activates when there is a hot water demand. Tankless hot water heater models offer great savings in in a variety of ways. We understand that when your water heater stops working, you will want a solution as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Also, electric heaters last only about half as long as gas units: Typical warranties are three to five years. Repair your water heater. We work to provide you with long-lasting solutions, and always take the time to solve your plumbing repair issues the first time. You can replace these yourself following the manufacturer's instructions, or call a water heater service professional. The lime scale acts as an insulator, reducing heat-transfer efficiency (the fraction of heat energy that moves from the burner to the water) and increasing thermal stress, which can ultimately reduce the water heater's lifespan.</p>

<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
