<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there.

Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs.
