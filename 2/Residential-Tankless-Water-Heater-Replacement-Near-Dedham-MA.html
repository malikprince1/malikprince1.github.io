<h2>Water Heater Services Dedham Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Gas tankless water heaters have a longer life expectancy than traditional tank water heaters. At Green Hills Plumbing we offer quality tankless water heater installation and service. Numerous people don't consider purchasing a new hot water heater until their old ones break down, yet the newer models could end up saving the home owner money in terms of energy expenditures so purchasing one now might save money for the household.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>

<p>I read on the internet that the Algebraens sell the dirty water from the old water heater as mineral enhanced bottled water. We provide free estimates for water heater replacement. Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>Even though the energy cost savings of installing a tankless wanter heater are attractive, your savings can be offset by the upfront costs of one, which are far greater than a traditional system.

The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute recommends playing it safe by replacing your system, rather than repairing it. A professional water heater, boiler, or furnace repair specialist will be able to make the call for your individual case.</p>
<p>In addition, structural repairs such as replacing damaged drywall or cabinetry may be required. When you turn on a hot water tap, cold water supply is directed to flow through the heating unit. When you turn on the first shower, that cold water moves to the water heater. Traditional - A traditional water heater comes with a sizable tank, where hot water is stored until it is needed.

<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>If this is impossible and only a single unit can be installed, you will discover that it can not give hot water for multiple units. Usually, when a hot water heater gives out, owners are forced to make a split-second decision to make sure that residents get their hot water back ASAP. Our expert team of plumbers, electricians, heating repair technicians, AC repair technicians, and system design managers performs top-quality repairs and installations while ensuring you are completely satisfied with your entire customer service.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot. If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>

<p>Calculating an everyday tank water heater can be easier than a tankless water heater. This contractor will check out your water heater, maintain its performance or fix any problems with it. Furthermore, they also know how to take out faulty parts and replace them with new ones. If you have a GE or Rheem water heater and booked a service call to repair your unit, please cancel your appointment. Replacement of this may cost $300 to $400, installed.</p>
