We sell a complete line of gas and electric hot water heaters from top manufacturers like Rheem, Bradford White, Bosch, State, Reliance, Noritz and A. Smith. Be sure to let us know if you plan on installing a hot tub, spa, or jacuzzi in the future. A properly installed tankless heater can certainly save a large amount of energy over a traditional water heater. A cold shower is a sure sign that your Gwinn home needs water heater maintenance.</p>
<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Removal - Most plumbers will charge between $250 and $500 to take the old water heater out and take it away for proper disposal. That's where an annual tank flush can come in handy, as it can remove these harmful sediments and ensure that your hot water tank is working at maximum efficiency. Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor. The issue here is that you have used a lot of energy to heat the entire tank's capacity yet you do not use all of it. This equates to wasted resources and it is certainly reflected on your energy bill.</p>

<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it.
