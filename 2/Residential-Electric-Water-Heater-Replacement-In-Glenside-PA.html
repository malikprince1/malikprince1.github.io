Anthony PHC Kansas City helps you upgrade to an instant water heater. In the colder months, it might not be an issue with your water heater. Before you start you need to make sure you have sufficient space for the tankless water heater you will be installing.

You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
