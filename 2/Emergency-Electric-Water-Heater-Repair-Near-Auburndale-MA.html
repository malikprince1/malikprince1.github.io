<p>A plumbing problem isn't always an if emergency , but when it is, wouldn't you like to be protected? The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement.

If it's a gas water heater use your two pipe wrenches and disconnect the union, that is between the supply pipe and the inlet pipe or it might be a flared fitting.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>

<p>Traditional storage water heaters. Less expensive to run - Because these systems only consume energy when there's a demand for hot water, they're more fuel efficient than storage systems, which must keep up a steady supply of heat to maintain water temperature. 1) I needed a unit big enough to supply me with hot water for at least one shower and sink running at the same time.

<p>The worst traditional electric heaters are 93 percent efficient. Maybe your hot water heater has sprung a leak or it's just stopped working. If your home uses less than 42 gallons of hot water daily, a tankless water heater can operate up to 34 percent more efficiently than a storage tank water heater. Upper thermostat may have failed and requires replacement or heating element may have failed and requires replacement.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>Some homeowners find that local building codes have changed and that after their water heater is repaired, upgrades to the venting system, drain pan and other components are needed. Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>This is an important and a safety component of a hot water heater tank. The conventional heater and storage tank that is installed mostly in garages has undergone some very good improvements that make them much more efficient with a faster recovery period and with less gas or electricity usage. It's just that some water heaters come with a filter screen at the cold water inlet that requires cleaning every once in a while.</p>
<p>The installation of a tankless system is a step forward in technology and greener, more efficient living. A corroded tank cannot be repaired and must be replaced. You can get a better performing water heater installed in your home on your schedule by using our prompt service. Then put on a hose on the bottom on the hot water tank to drain the left over water out of the tank.
