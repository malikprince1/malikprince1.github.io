<h2>Water Heater Services Fountain Colorado</h2>
<p>If it is that time when you are looking to replace your old hot water heater, then it is time to consider changing out to something different. Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>

While they are more expensive than traditional units, the amount of money you will save on your water bill and your electricity or gas bill will be well worth the added investment. Storage tank water heaters have an energy factor of 0.59, on average.</p>

Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>

Space-saving tankless water heaters only heat water when you call for it. This model of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water as it's needed.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet. If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

<p>If you don't know how old your heater is, your local plumber will be able to find out by reading the serial number on the tank. This type of water heater has improved a lot over the years, and today's models are more efficient and reliable than ever before.

Old water heaters aren't just inefficient, they are inconvenient. Fixed the tank less water heater. I've been doing plumbing for 4 years I like this job and I hope to continue doing it for a long time with the ambition of being able to continue growing in the business, always providing the best service to all my clients.</p>
