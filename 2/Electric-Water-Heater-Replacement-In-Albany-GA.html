<h2>Water Heater Services Albany Georgia</h2>
<p>Your water heater is one of the single most expensive components of your plumbing system. Typically, Houston water heater tanks are made of steel and lined with glass to prevent the steel from rusting. We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase.

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>Because a direct vent water heater has fewer moving parts in it with fewer things to go wrong, it will carry either a 6-, 9- or 12-year warranty, whereas a powered vent water heater will typically cap out at a 6-year warranty.
