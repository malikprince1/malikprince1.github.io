<h2>Water Heater Services Imlay City Michigan</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>The water heater produces loud popping or cracking noises during use. So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>

<p>Whether we simply need to replace a broken part, remove excess sediment, repair the heating element, or do something else entirely, we'll make safety our priority. You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting. Answers to this issue are turning up the heat dial on the water heater, insulating the hot water pipes, moving the water heater, installing a second water heater or adding a recirculating pump system.</p>

The main differences include that a direct vent heater uses an inducer motor to boost the removal of exhaust gas and can be vented with PVC pipe. Internal corrosions is most likely occurring in your water heater and it's time to consider replacing it with a more efficient, modern model. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>As long as a large enough water heater is installed, it's not a problem. Depending on the age of your water heater, the repair may be simpler and more affordable than you think. This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
