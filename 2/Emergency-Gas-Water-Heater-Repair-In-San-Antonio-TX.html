<p>You can't just walk into your local home center and pick the cheapest water heater from the display. Kenmore makes gas and electric water heaters. Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water. This then makes textiles, cloths, papers, and wood into potential fire hazards if left carelessly near the heating element of the heater.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker.

<p>Ensure to flush the water heater tank once every year. But if you're building a new home or adding to an existing one, installing a tankless water heater may make economic sense. If one of them isn't working, you'll still get hot water but it won't be as much as you're used to.

And when soldering or welding, remember to flush the pipes before connecting them to the water heater and that excess heat can cause damage to the unit.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart.

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
