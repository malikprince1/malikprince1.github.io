<h2>Water Heater Services Woodland Park Colorado</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>Usually, these tanks hold enough hot water to meet the needs of the entire house. When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Repair Woodland Park</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>If you use smaller individual heaters at more localized locations, your electrical services will not be as taxed. Whichever type of tank you choose, Quality Plumbing's experienced team of technicians will be able to install and service your heaters will confidence. Also turn off the water to the water heater and release pressure by lifting the lever on the TP valve as he shows. Age is another factor we consider when inspecting your water heater.</p>
<p>How they work: Tank water heaters typically hold between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water (around 120 degrees Fahrenheit) in a storage tank. If the incoming water pressure is above 150 psi a pressure reducing valve must be installed upstream of the heater. Here are the biggest benefits of installing a tankless water heater in your home. These systems are capable of providing your home with unlimited hot water, all while lowering your energy bills.</p>

Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>Turn on the circuit breaker and run the hot water heater to verify that it is heating the water effectively. Mount the tankless water heater securely to the platform. On the other hand, if you have a non-leaking water heater and no hot water, you can often correct that yourself without calling a plumber. What's more, there are certainly cost savings to replacing all traditional water heaters with tankless water heaters at the same time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you find a water damaged spot, you can trace the water stain back to the problematic leaking pipe. Allow the tank to fill completely and then turn on the electricity or gas again. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, generate hot water only when you require it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when installed in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>
