<p>If it is that time when you are looking to replace your old hot water heater, then it is time to consider changing out to something different. Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket.

When it comes to tankless water heaters there really is nothing we can't do and do really well. Removing your current water heater cost anywhere from $100 to $500. The most common issues that occur in regards to tankless water heaters are system overload, mineral buildup, flame failure, or an exhaust blockage.</p>
