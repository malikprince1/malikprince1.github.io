<h2>Water Heater Services Dardanelle Arkansas</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years.

The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up.

<p>The conventional gas storage water heater is roughly $100 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over the same 15 year time period. This provides an endless supply of hot water regardless of how many people need to take showers, how much laundry needs to get done, or how often you need to run the dishwasher. Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>
