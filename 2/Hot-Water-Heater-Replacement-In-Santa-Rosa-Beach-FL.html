<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>The basic premise behind a tankless heater is that the water is not forced to stay within a tank, being heated and reheated until it's used. High Recovery Water Heaters Make sure your water heater meets your household demands with a high recovery rate. As a result, tankless heaters are able to supply a constant stream of hot water. If you are switching from electric to LPG gas hot water system the gas hot water heater installation cost would typically be in the $1200 to $3000 range.</p>

This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
