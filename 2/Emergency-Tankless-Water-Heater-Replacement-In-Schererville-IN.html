<h2>Water Heater Services Schererville Indiana</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Highly efficient water heaters such as tankless coil and indirect ones use less energy than conventional units, saving homeowners money on their utility bills in the long run. Hot water can add up to 25% of your energy bill, so be sure to choose an energy efficient heating appliance. These signs could mean that it's time to look into water heater repair. While a tankless water heater can provide an unlimited amount of hot water, it can only provide a limited volume.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced.

<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater.

The smaller unit reduces your risk of getting scalded, since huge amounts of hot water aren't stored in a tank, but rather are processed as needed.</p>
<p>If your tank is leaking or the water is no longer running clear, these are cases where you absolutely have to replace your heater altogether. Copy the nameplate data of the water heater to purchase correct replacement parts. As water heaters generally hold 50 gallons of water, a breakdown can result in a damaging flood. If repair is not an option, we will help you determine the best replacement. One set of coils is the water line, the other, the heating element.</p>
