<h2>Water Heater Services Sandy Hook Connecticut</h2>
<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready.

<p>If you need professional water heater installation or replacement, you have come to the right place. Also, test all wires in the water heater with a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off before touching the wires. The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months. When you replace a water heater, you are also expected to bring the water heating system up to current building codes While the cost of doing this is not directly part of the cost of the water heater, the two should be calculated together to find an estimate of the total expense.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>

We also provide emergency plumbing services 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When properly maintained, tankless water heaters often have a lifespan of at least 20 years (approximately twice that of conventional storage tanks).</p>

<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
