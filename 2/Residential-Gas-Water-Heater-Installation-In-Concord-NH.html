The life expectancy of a water heater is typically eight to twelve years and, here in our area, it will typically be fueled by gas or electric. Follow these steps to install the new water heater.

A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased. Gas is more energy efficient and cheaper to run, but electric will not make a drastic difference. Tankless Water Heaters have become a really hot commodity in the last couple of years (I know, that was a really bad pun).</p>

There should be a large circular opening near the bottom of the heater to attach the new temperature and pressure relief valve to. If you don't see one, consult the manufacturer's guide. They can range from the usual water heaters that simply store a tank of hot water for the household's use.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gas or propane fueled tankless water heaters have better power efficient but more complex installation process. A tankless water heater system operates by using a line or pipe. Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Whether you choose gas or electric, there are many ways to get savings out of a tankless hot water heater.</p>
