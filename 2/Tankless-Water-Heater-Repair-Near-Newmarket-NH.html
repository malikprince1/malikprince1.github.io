<p>Enjoy reliable water heater servicing and protection with Miracle Plumbing Inc. We have many years of experience working on all types of hot water heaters. Besides sizing the unit appropriately, I'll want to know what the manufacturer's minimum flow rate is, what type of water quality is required by the manufacturer, and exactly what the warranty covers.

<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
